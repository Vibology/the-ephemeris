# Chokmah
*Wisdom — The First Movement of Creation*

---

## Overview

**Chokmah** (Hebrew: חכמה, "Wisdom") is the second Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]] — the first emanation from [[Kether]] that introduces differentiation into unity. If Kether is the dimensionless point, Chokmah is the **line** — pure force extending outward, the first movement, the creative impulse before it takes form.

Chokmah is the **supernal Father** (*Abba*), the active masculine principle that projects creative energy toward [[Binah]] (the Mother) for shaping. It is associated with the entire Zodiac — not one planet but the whole wheel of fixed stars — because Chokmah's energy is not yet channeled into any specific form. It is *all* potential directions at once.

## Source Teachings

### Sefer Yetzirah: The Illuminating Intelligence

The Sefer Yetzirah designates Chokmah as the "**Illuminating Intelligence**" (*Sekhel Mazchir*) — "the crown of creation, the splendor of unity, equalling it."[^1] Where Kether is hidden, Chokmah is the first flash of light that *can* be perceived — not yet an object of knowledge, but the illumination that makes knowledge possible.

The Yetzirah associates each Sephirah with a "depth" (*omek*): Chokmah is the **depth of beginning** — the first polarization within the undifferentiated unity, the moment when One becomes the possibility of Two.

### The Zohar: Abba and the Point of Wisdom

In the Zohar, Chokmah is called **Abba** ("Father"), the supernal masculine paired with Binah as **Imma** ("Mother").[^2] Their union produces all subsequent emanation — the lower seven Sephiroth are their "children."

The Zohar's most vivid image: when the Ancient of Days (Kether) wished to create, a single **point of light** shot forth — this is Chokmah, the "beginning" (*reshit*) referenced in the first word of Genesis: *be-reshit* ("in the beginning"). The Zohar reads *be-reshit* as "**with Wisdom** He created" — Chokmah is the instrument of creation, the first thing God employs.[^3]

The Bahir adds that Wisdom is like a **spring that never ceases** — water flowing from an inexhaustible source, giving without depleting, the Father's nature being boundless generosity.[^4]

### Wang: The Zodiac and Dynamic Will

Wang emphasizes that Chokmah's attribution to the entire Zodiac (rather than a single planet) reflects its nature as **undifferentiated creative force**.[^5] It is the vital energy of the cosmos before that energy is channeled through any specific planetary lens. Where the lower Sephiroth each correspond to a particular planet (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, etc.), Chokmah encompasses them all as pure stellar radiance.

## The Twos in Tarot

The four **Twos** correspond to Chokmah — the first polarity, the moment potential bifurcates:

- **Two of Wands** (Mars in Aries) — Dominion: the first assertion of will over a field of possibility
- **Two of Cups** (Venus in Cancer) — Love: the first recognition of self in another
- **Two of Swords** (Moon in Libra) — Peace: the balanced tension before a decision is made
- **Two of Pentacles** (Jupiter in Capricorn) — Change: the dynamic equilibrium of forces in motion

The Twos represent Chokmah's gift descending into the four worlds: the raw creative impulse taking its first specific shape. They are the moment after the Ace's pure potential — the first move in the game, still charged with all of the Ace's energy but now *directed*.

## Jungian Parallels

Chokmah corresponds to the **Logos** — Jung's term for the masculine principle of consciousness that differentiates, names, and orders.[^6] Where Kether is the Self as undifferentiated ground, Chokmah is the Self's first creative act: the impulse to *know* that generates the knower.

In the psyche, Chokmah operates as the flash of insight — the moment when an idea arrives whole, before the ego has processed it. This is not intellectual analysis (that belongs to [[Hod]]) but *revelation*: the lightning flash that splits the darkness of the unconscious and illuminates a pattern. The idea then passes to Binah (Understanding) for structuring, just as Chokmah's force passes to the supernal Mother for form.

Chokmah's shadow is inflation through identification with the creative impulse — the artist who believes they *are* the muse rather than its vessel.

---

## The Observatory Reading

Chokmah reminds the practitioner that the first act of understanding is not analysis but **reception of the flash**. Before you organize data into systems, before you cross-reference correspondences, something must *arrive* — an intuition, a pattern perceived, a resonance felt. That initial flash is Chokmah's gift. The Observatory's instruments do not generate what they observe; they *receive* it.

The danger is mistaking the flash for the finished work. Chokmah without Binah is insight without comprehension — brilliant but ungrounded.
