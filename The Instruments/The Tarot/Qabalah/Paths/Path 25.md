# Path 25 — Samekh
*The Arrow — Yesod to Tiphareth, The Path of Testing*

---

## Overview

**Path 25** connects [[Yesod]] (Foundation, the Moon, the personal unconscious) to [[Tiphareth]] (Beauty, the Sun, the Higher Self). It is the **Path of Samekh** (ס), the Hebrew letter meaning "support" or "prop" — the staff that holds the tent upright, the arrow aimed at the heart of the sun.

This is the **most direct path** from personality to soul. On the [[Middle Pillar]], Path 25 is the vertical highway between the lunar and solar centers — between the ego's dream of itself (Yesod) and the Self's actual nature (Tiphareth). It is associated with [[Temperance (XIV)]], the Tarot trump of alchemical integration, and with **Sagittarius**, the centaur whose arrow flies upward from instinct toward truth.

The path is called "The Intelligence of Probation" or "Testing" in the Sefer Yetzirah.[^1] It *tests* because the journey from personality to Higher Self is not a gentle ascent but a trial: the ego must prove that it can bear the solar light without inflating, that it can relinquish its lunar fantasies without collapsing.

## Hebrew Letter Mysteries

### Samekh (ס) — Support

The letter Samekh (ס) is a **closed circle** — the only completely enclosed letter in the Hebrew alphabet.[^2] This closure represents the divine support that surrounds and sustains the aspirant during the dangerous transit between the lunar and solar worlds. Without Samekh's encircling protection, the ego would be destroyed by the transition rather than transformed by it.

The word *Samekh* means "to support" or "to lean upon." The Zohar teaches that God "supports those who are falling" (*somekh noflim*) — a phrase from the daily liturgy that directly invokes this letter's principle.[^3] Path 25 is the path where the aspirant learns to *lean on* something beyond the ego: the very act of surrender that the ego finds most terrifying is the act that provides the greatest support.

The circular form also represents the **alchemical vessel** — the sealed container within which transformation occurs. Temperance's two cups, pouring fluid between them, operate within this sealed circle. Nothing is lost; nothing is added; what changes is the *arrangement*.

## The Journey: Yesod to Tiphareth

### Leaving Yesod

Yesod is the Moon — the realm of reflection, imagination, dreams, and the personal unconscious. It is where the ego assembles its self-image from reflections: how others see us, how we imagine ourselves, the fantasies and fears that compose our sense of identity. Yesod is comfortable because it is *ours* — our story, our self-portrait, our carefully curated dream.

Path 25 begins when the aspirant realizes that the reflection is not the reality — that the self-image assembled in Yesod, however elaborate, is a **lunar portrait**: beautiful, shifting, and ultimately insubstantial. Something in the psyche begins to aim *upward*, past the moon, toward the sun.

### The Crossing

The transit is not gradual but **alchemical** — a transformation of substance, not merely a change of location. Lunar consciousness (reflective, receptive, mutable) must become solar consciousness (radiant, unified, centered). This requires the aspirant to:

1. **Surrender the self-image** — The lunar personality, built from reflections, must be released. This is not ego-death (that belongs to [[The Abyss]]) but ego-*transparency*: the ego becomes a clear lens rather than a distorting mirror.

2. **Endure the testing** — Sagittarius tests through experience. The centaur learns by traveling, by encountering otherness, by being burned by the fire it carries. Path 25's tests are experiential, not theoretical — the aspirant is tested by *living*, not by knowing.

3. **Integrate the opposites** — Temperance's central act: pouring fire into water, water into fire, without destroying either. The personality and the soul are not opponents; they are two phases of the same substance.

### Arriving at Tiphareth

Tiphareth is the Sun — the heart of the Tree, the place where all paths converge. Arrival at Tiphareth is the **first encounter with the Self**: the realization that there is a center to the psyche that is not the ego, that the ego serves rather than commands, and that this center is beautiful — not in the decorative sense but in the mathematical sense: *harmonious*.

## Temperance (XIV) as Path Symbol

[[Temperance (XIV)]] is the Tarot's image of Path 25: the **angel pouring water between two cups**, one foot on land and one in water, a triangle of fire on the breast, a path leading to a distant crown of light.

### The Pouring

The two cups are Yesod and Tiphareth — Moon and Sun, personality and soul. The angel does not *choose* one over the other but **circulates** between them, creating a continuous flow. This is tempering in the metallurgical sense: the repeated heating and cooling that makes steel both hard and flexible.[^4]

The angel stands with one foot in water (unconscious, Yesod) and one on land (conscious, grounded). This is the posture of the practitioner who can navigate between inner and outer worlds without losing balance.

### The Arrow

In many Temperance images, the distant path leads to a crown or golden light on the horizon — Tiphareth's solar radiance. Sagittarius's arrow is this trajectory: the aim upward, the trajectory that cannot be controlled once released, the faith that the arrow knows its target. The Archer does not guide the arrow in flight; the Archer's work is in the *aiming*.

## Astrological Correspondence: Sagittarius

**[[Sagittarius ♐]]** brings its full meaning to this path:

- **The Centaur** — Half animal, half human: the integration of instinct (horse) and aspiration (archer). Path 25 does not transcend the body but *integrates* it. The arrow is fired *from* the horse, not *instead of* the horse.
- **Jupiter's rulership** — Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter ([[Chesed]]), bringing the expansive, generous, meaning-seeking quality to the path. The journey from Yesod to Tiphareth is a journey toward *meaning* — toward the larger context that gives the personality its significance.
- **Mutable Fire** — Adaptable, searching, restless. The fire of Sagittarius is not the fixed blaze of Leo or the explosive spark of Aries but the fire of the *quest* — the flame that moves, that seeks, that refuses to settle.
- **The Ninth House** — Philosophy, higher education, foreign travel, the expansion of horizons. Path 25 is a journey to a "foreign country" — the Higher Self is foreign to the ego, and reaching it requires the ego to become a traveler rather than a resident.

## Jungian Parallels

Path 25 corresponds to the decisive moment in [[Individuation Process|individuation]] when the ego first encounters the **Self** as a reality rather than a concept.[^5]

Jung distinguished between the ego (the center of conscious identity) and the Self (the center of the total psyche, including the unconscious). The ego's natural assumption is that it *is* the center — that consciousness is the whole of the psyche. The encounter with the Self shatters this assumption: there is a center greater than the ego, and the ego's proper role is not to rule but to *serve* that center.

This encounter is what Path 25 describes. It is experienced as:
- **Numinous** — The Self appears with the quality of the sacred, the "wholly other" that Rudolf Otto described
- **Paradoxical** — The Self is both intimate (closer than the ego to itself) and alien (vaster than anything the ego has encountered)
- **Demanding** — The Self asks the ego to relinquish its sovereignty, which is experienced as a death (the "testing" of Path 25's Intelligence of Probation)

The Temperance angel is the **transcendent function** in Jungian terms — the psychic function that mediates between conscious and unconscious, integrating their opposites into a new synthesis that neither could produce alone.[^6]

## The Observatory Reading

Path 25 is the path the practitioner walks every time they sit with a chart. The movement from data (Yesod — reflected information) to meaning (Tiphareth — synthesized understanding) is the same movement the arrow makes: upward from the particular to the harmonious. The chart is the bow; the reading is the aim; the synthesis is the arrow in flight.

The testing of this path is the temptation to *stay* in Yesod — to accumulate data without synthesizing, to reflect endlessly without centering, to know about the Self without encountering it. The arrow must be released.

## Notes

[^1]: Sefer Yetzirah — Path 25 as the "Intelligence of Probation" or "Tentative Intelligence" (*Sekhel Nisyoni*). The testing of the soul's readiness for solar consciousness.

[^2]: Wang, *The Qabalistic Tarot* — Samekh as the only completely enclosed Hebrew letter; the circular form representing divine protection and the alchemical vessel.

[^3]: Zohar; daily liturgy (*Ashrei*) — *Somekh noflim* ("He supports the falling"), invoking the root meaning of Samekh as divine support for those in transition.

[^4]: Crowley, *The Book of Thoth* — Temperance as "Art" in the Thoth deck; the alchemical marriage of opposites, the pouring between vessels as the metallurgical tempering of the soul.

[^5]: Jung, CW 9ii (*Aion*) — The ego-Self axis; the encounter with the Self as the decisive moment in individuation, requiring the ego to relinquish its claim to centrality.

[^6]: Jung, CW 8 (*The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche*) — The transcendent function as the mediating process between conscious and unconscious positions, producing a "third" that is neither.
