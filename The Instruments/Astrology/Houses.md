# The Twelve Houses
*The Domains of Life Experience*

---

## Overview

The **twelve astrological houses** divide the celestial sphere into twelve domains, each governing specific areas of life experience. Where the zodiac signs represent *how* energy expresses (qualities, elements, modalities), and the planets represent *what* energies are active (drives, archetypes), the houses represent *where* these energies manifest—the stages upon which life unfolds.

The house system is **geocentric and time-dependent**—calculated based on the exact time and location of birth. The houses describe the rotation of Earth on its axis (24-hour daily cycle), distinguishing them from the zodiac, which describes Earth's orbit around the Sun (12-month yearly cycle).

### The Four Angles

Four houses mark the primary angles of the chart:

1. **1st House (Ascendant/ASC)** — Eastern horizon, rising sign, dawn, identity presentation
2. **10th House (Midheaven/MC)** — Southern zenith (Northern Hemisphere), highest point, noon, public reputation
3. **7th House (Descendant/DSC)** — Western horizon, setting sun, dusk, partnership
4. **4th House (Imum Coeli/IC)** — Northern nadir (Northern Hemisphere), lowest point, midnight, private foundation

These four angles are the **cardinal points** of the chart, marking the most powerful and visible areas of life.

## The Three Classifications

Traditional astrology organizes the twelve houses into three categories based on their relationship to the angles:

### Angular Houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th)

**Quality:** Powerful, active, initiating, visible

The angular houses are the **cardinal points**—they mark the horizon (Ascendant/Descendant) and meridian (MC/IC) of the chart. Planets in angular houses are said to have the most strength and visibility—they act decisively and shape life overtly.

**Lilly's teaching:** Angular houses are the most powerful. Planets here "do their work with strength and efficacy."[^1]

### Succedent Houses (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th)

**Quality:** Fixed, stabilizing, consolidating, sustaining

The succedent houses *follow* the angles (Latin *succedere* = "to follow"). They represent the consolidation and stabilization of what the angular houses initiated. These are houses of **resources, values, and established patterns**.

**Traditional correspondence:** Succedent houses correspond to the fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius).

### Cadent Houses (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th)

**Quality:** Mutable, transitional, preparatory, mental

The cadent houses *fall away* from the angles (Latin *cadere* = "to fall"). They represent transition, preparation, and mental/spiritual realms. These are houses of **learning, service, and hidden matters**.

**Traditional correspondence:** Cadent houses correspond to the mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces).

**Lilly's teaching:** Cadent houses are the weakest in traditional astrology. Planets here act "with less vigor" and often signify delays, setbacks, or internal/preparatory work.[^1]

## The Natural Zodiac Correspondence

Each house corresponds naturally to a zodiac sign and its planetary ruler. This system (popularized in modern astrology) treats the 1st House as naturally corresponding to Aries (and Mars), the 2nd to Taurus (and Venus), and so on.

| House | Natural Sign | Planetary Ruler | Domain |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| **1st** | [[Aries ♈]] | [[Mars ♂]] | Identity, Appearance, Ascendant |
| **2nd** | [[Taurus ♉]] | [[Venus ♀]] | Resources, Values, Possessions |
| **3rd** | [[Gemini ♊]] | [[Mercury ☿]] | Communication, Siblings, Local Environment |
| **4th** | [[Cancer ♋]] | [[Moon ☽]] | Home, Family, Roots, IC |
| **5th** | [[Leo ♌]] | [[Sun ☉]] | Creativity, Pleasure, Children |
| **6th** | [[Virgo ♍]] | [[Mercury ☿]] | Work, Health, Service, Daily Routine |
| **7th** | [[Libra ♎]] | [[Venus ♀]] | Partnership, Marriage, Descendant |
| **8th** | [[Scorpio ♏]] | [[Pluto ♇]] / [[Mars ♂]] | Death, Transformation, Shared Resources |
| **9th** | [[Sagittarius ♐]] | [[Jupiter ♃]] | Philosophy, Travel, Higher Education |
| **10th** | [[Capricorn ♑]] | [[Saturn ♄]] | Career, Reputation, MC |
| **11th** | [[Aquarius ♒]] | [[Uranus ♅]] / [[Saturn ♄]] | Community, Hopes, Friends |
| **12th** | [[Pisces ♓]] | [[Neptune ♆]] / [[Jupiter ♃]] | Spirituality, Hidden Matters, Sorrow |

**Note:** In an actual birth chart, the houses are defined by the Ascendant (rising sign) and house system used (Placidus, Whole Sign, etc.), not by this natural correspondence. This table shows the *archetypal* relationship between houses and signs.

## Planetary Joys

Traditional astrology assigns each planet a house where it "joys"—where it feels most at home and expresses its nature most freely:[^2]

| Planet | Joy House | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **[[Mercury ☿]]** | 1st House | Communication of identity, mental quickness visible in presentation |
| **[[Moon ☽]]** | 3rd House | Daily rhythms, local environment, siblings (lunar domain) |
| **[[Venus ♀]]** | 5th House | Pleasure, creativity, beauty, romance, children |
| **[[Mars ♂]]** | 6th House | Labor, conflict, enemies, the daily battle of work |
| **[[Sun ☉]]** | 9th House | Philosophy, higher wisdom, divine illumination, expansion |
| **[[Jupiter ♃]]** | 11th House | Hopes, community, good fortune from friendships |
| **[[Saturn ♄]]** | 12th House | Sorrow, isolation, limitation, "the prison" |

This system is **traditional** (from Hellenistic and Medieval astrology) and differs from the natural zodiac correspondence above.

## House Systems

Different house systems calculate house cusps differently. The most common systems are:

**Whole Sign Houses:** Each house occupies an entire zodiac sign (30°). The Ascendant's sign becomes the entire 1st House, the next sign becomes the 2nd House, etc. This is the **oldest system** (Hellenistic) and the simplest.

**Placidus:** The most popular modern system. Calculates house cusps based on the diurnal arc (the time it takes each degree to rise, culminate, and set). Houses are unequal in size. Does not work at extreme latitudes.

**Koch, Regiomontanus, Campanus, etc.:** Various mathematical systems, each with slightly different results. Traditional astrologers often prefer Regiomontanus; modern psychological astrologers often use Placidus or Koch.

**Equal House:** All houses are exactly 30° starting from the Ascendant degree, but the signs may not align perfectly with house boundaries.

**Note:** The choice of house system can significantly affect which planets fall in which houses, especially for planets near house cusps. Whole Sign avoids this ambiguity.

## Cross-System Integration

### Human Design

In Human Design, the **houses do not map directly** to the system. However:
- The **Ascendant (1st House cusp)** activates a specific gate in the Personality (conscious) chart
- Planetary positions in houses affect which gates are activated
- The **MC (10th House cusp)** relates to public expression and often activates gates in expression centers (Throat)

### Tarot

The twelve houses resonate with Tarot's Court Cards (which also follow a fourfold structure) and the zodiacal attributions of the Major Arcana:

- **1st House** — [[The Magician (I)]] (identity manifestation)
- **4th House** — [[The Moon (XVIII)]] (hidden foundation, the unconscious)
- **7th House** — [[The Lovers (VI)]] (partnership, choice)
- **10th House** — [[The Emperor (IV)]] or [[The World (XXI)]] (mastery, public authority)

### Jungian Psychology

- **1st House** — [[The Persona]] (social mask)
- **4th House** — [[The Great Mother]], family complex, unconscious foundation
- **7th House** — [[The Anima]] / [[The Animus]] (projected inner opposite)
- **8th House** — [[The Shadow]], death-rebirth, underworld descent
- **12th House** — [[The Collective Unconscious]], dissolution of ego boundaries
