# Elohim Tzabaoth
*God of Hosts — The Divine Name of Hod*

---

## Overview

**Elohim Tzabaoth** (Hebrew: אלהים צבאות, "God of Hosts") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Hod]]** (Splendor), the eighth Sephirah on the [[The Tree of Life]] — the sphere of Mercury, intellect, analysis, communication, and ceremonial magic.

The name combines:
- **Elohim** (אלהים) — "Gods" (the plural form used for the One God), emphasizing divine multiplicity-in-unity, the God who works *through form and structure*
- **Tzabaoth** (צבאות) — "Hosts" or "Armies," the celestial legions commanded through precise order

Where [[YHVH Tzabaoth]] at [[Netzach]] commands the divine hosts through desire and attraction, Elohim Tzabaoth commands them through **form, language, and ceremonial structure**. The same armies, two modes of command: the heart and the mind.

## Source Teachings

### The Zohar: The Name of Form

The Zohar associates the title *Tzabaoth* (Hosts) jointly with Netzach and Hod, calling them the **"supports of the central pillar"** and the **"source of prophecy."**[^1] Prophecy flows through these two Sephiroth because prophecy requires both the emotional/visionary receptivity of Netzach and the intellectual/communicative clarity of Hod. The prophet *sees* through Netzach and *speaks* through Hod.

The name **Elohim** (as opposed to YHVH) signals the Severity side of the pairing. Elohim is the name of God in judgment — the God who creates through *separation* (dividing light from darkness, waters above from waters below). At Hod, this separative, form-giving power operates through the intellect: the capacity to distinguish, categorize, analyze, and name with precision.[^2]

### Elohim: Multiplicity in Unity

The grammatical peculiarity of *Elohim* — a plural noun used with singular verbs — mirrors Hod's function. The intellect works by *multiplying distinctions* while serving a *single purpose*: understanding. Elohim Tzabaoth is God commanding the many through the one — the general who gives specific orders to each division of an army, each angel to its post, each letter to its place in the word.

## Hod and Ceremonial Magic

Hod is the Sephirah of **ceremonial magic** — the practice of invoking spiritual forces through precise ritual forms, exact words, correct timing, and structured procedure. This is because Hod embodies the Mercurial principle: communication, precision, the *word* as instrument of power.

Elohim Tzabaoth is therefore the name most associated with **ritual efficacy** — the divine authority behind the words of power. When the ceremonial magician vibrates a divine name, traces a pentagram, or invokes an archangel at the correct quarter, they are operating under Elohim Tzabaoth's jurisdiction: *the God who commands through form*.

The LBRP, the Middle Pillar Exercise, the Hexagram Rituals — all draw on Hod's principle that spiritual forces respond to **precise formulation**. The word must be exact. The gesture must be correct. The timing must be right. This is not superstition but the Mercurial understanding that form *matters* — that the structure of an invocation is part of its content.

## The Netzach-Hod Polarity

See [[YHVH Tzabaoth]] for the full comparison table. In brief:

- **Netzach** (YHVH Tzabaoth) = The *why* — desire, motivation, the emotional force that drives
- **Hod** (Elohim Tzabaoth) = The *how* — method, technique, the intellectual form that channels

A practitioner strong in Netzach but weak in Hod has passion without technique. A practitioner strong in Hod but weak in Netzach has technique without inspiration. Both must converge in [[Yesod]] (Foundation) before they can manifest in [[Malkuth]] (Kingdom).

---

## Jungian Parallels

Hod corresponds to the **thinking function** in Jung's typology — the capacity to analyze, discriminate, and organize information according to logical principles.[^3] Elohim Tzabaoth is the divine name of the *logos* principle: the psychic force that separates, defines, and structures.

The "hosts" under this name are the **cognitive structures** — the categories, distinctions, and frameworks through which the mind organizes experience. Language itself is an army under Elohim Tzabaoth's command: each word a soldier deployed to hold meaning in place.

The danger of unbalanced Hod — logos without eros — is what Jung identified as the modern Western condition: a culture that can analyze everything and feel nothing, that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Elohim Tzabaoth without YHVH Tzabaoth produces intellectual brilliance that serves no deeper purpose.

## Notes

[^1]: Zohar — Netzach and Hod as the "supports of the central pillar" and the "source of prophecy," associated jointly with the title *Tzabaoth* (Hosts).

[^2]: Zohar — Elohim as the name of God in judgment and separation. Genesis 1 uses *Elohim* throughout the creation narrative: "Elohim divided the light from the darkness" (1:4).

[^3]: Jung, CW 6 (*Psychological Types*) — Thinking as a rational function that organizes experience according to logical principles; logos as the discriminating, structuring aspect of consciousness.
