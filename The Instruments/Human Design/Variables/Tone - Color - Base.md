# Tone - Color - Base
*The deeper architecture of consciousness*

---

## Introduction: Below the Surface

**Tone, Color, and Base** represent the **internal substructure** of the Crystals of Consciousness—the layers of architecture beneath the surface [[Variables]] ([[Determination]], [[Environment]], [[Perspective]], [[Motivation]]).[^1]

#### The Structure
- **Variables** (surface layer) = What you see in practical application
- **Color** (messenger layer) = The exit frequency transferring information from Tone to Line
- **Tone** (architecture layer) = The internal frequency determining cognition and Left/Right orientation
- **Base** (entry layer) = The entry point of the neutrino stream

**Why this matters:**
- Understanding Tone/Color/Base reveals the **mechanical depth** of Human Design—how consciousness is structured at the subatomic level
- **Advanced PHS practitioners** use Tone/Color/Base (Advanced Imaging) to diagnose and prescribe specific dietary regimens
- Tone determines **Left vs. Right** orientation across all Variables—the fundamental cognitive split (Strategic vs. Receptive)
- This is the most **advanced** layer of Human Design—accessible only to students who have lived their design for years

**The Central Principle:** Variables are **not** arbitrary. They emerge from a precise **mathematical architecture** encoded in the Design and Personality Crystals at the moment of birth.

## Historical Context: The Revelation of Substructure

### The Voice and the Crystals (1987)

During Ra Uru Hu's eight-day encounter with "the Voice" on Ibiza, the revelation included not only the surface mechanics ([[Types]], Strategy and [[Authority]], [[Gates]], [[Channels]]) but also the **deep substructure**—the Crystals of Consciousness.

**What was revealed:**
- **Two Crystals** structure consciousness: the **Design Crystal** (body/unconscious) and the **Personality Crystal** (mind/conscious)
- Each Crystal contains an **internal hierarchy**: Tone → Color → Base → Line
- The **neutrino stream** enters through the Base, is organized by Tone, exits through Color, and manifests as Line
- This architecture is **fixed** at birth (Design: 88° before birth, Personality: at birth) and does not change

**Why this was not taught initially:**
- The substructure is **invisible** to conscious experience
- It cannot be "worked on" or manipulated—it simply **is**
- Teaching it prematurely feeds the Not-Self mind's desire for control
- Ra waited until the 2000s to teach **Rave Psychology** and **PHS** to advanced students

### The Mandala and the 64

The Human Design Mandala is based on the **64 hexagrams** of the I-Ching, which correspond to the 64 codons of DNA. Each hexagram is divided into **six Lines** (the structure of the hexagram), which are further divided into:

**6 Colors per Line** (6 × 6 = 36 total Color positions per hexagram)
**6 Tones per Color** (6 × 36 = 216 total Tone positions per hexagram)
**5 Bases per Tone** (5 × 216 = 1,080 total Base positions per hexagram)

**Total possibilities across 64 hexagrams:**
- **64** hexagrams (Gates)
- **384** Lines (64 × 6)
- **2,304** Colors (64 × 6 × 6)
- **13,824** Tones (64 × 6 × 6 × 6)
- **69,120** Bases (64 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 5)

**Implication:** Human differentiation is **not** a broad categorization (e.g., "4 Types"). At the Tone/Color/Base level, there are **thousands** of unique configurations—true individuation.

## The Three Layers: Tone, Color, Base

### Base: The Entry Point

**Function:** Base is the **entry frequency** of the neutrino stream. There are **5 Bases** (not 6, unlike Tone and Color).

**The Role of Base:**
- Determines the **initial imprint** as the neutrino stream enters the Crystal
- Critical for the alignment of the **Independent Variable** (Nodes—[[Environment]] and [[Perspective]])
- Advanced PHS practitioners use Base to fine-tune dietary prescriptions

**Why 5 Bases?**
The shift from 6 (hexagram structure) to 5 (Base structure) represents a **mathematical compression**—the neutrino stream enters through five distinct frequencies before expanding into six Tones.

**Practical Access:**
Base is **rarely** discussed outside advanced PHS training. Standard Human Design readings do not interpret Base—it is used primarily for diagnostic imaging in PHS.

### Tone: The Architecture

**Function:** Tone is the **internal frequency** inside the Crystal that determines:
- **Cognition** (how the mind processes reality)
- **Left vs. Right orientation** (Strategic vs. Receptive)
- **Sensory-cognitive binaries** (Smell/Taste, Outer/Inner Vision, Feeling/Touch)

**The Six Tones:**

**Tones 1-2: Splenic Binary (Survival)**
- **Tone 1: Smell** (Left) - Survival cognition through scent/instinct
- **Tone 2: Taste** (Right) - Survival cognition through selective intake

**Tones 3-4: Ajna Binary (Vision)**
- **Tone 3: Outer Vision** (Left) - Strategic, focused, action-oriented seeing
- **Tone 4: Inner Vision** (Right) - Meditative, receptive, contemplative seeing

**Tones 5-6: Solar Plexus Binary (Emotion/Sensation)**
- **Tone 5: Feeling** (Left) - Emotional/sensory cognition through active feeling
- **Tone 6: Touch** (Right) - Emotional/sensory cognition through receptive touch

**Left Tones (1, 3, 5): Strategic**
- **Active, focused, survival-oriented**
- Binocular vision—looking for specific targets
- Memory stored on "singular lines"—recalls by going back to focus

**Right Tones (2, 4, 6): Receptive**
- **Passive, peripheral, deep-intake**
- No specific focus—takes in whole field
- Memory stored as vast reservoir—retrieved when stimulated externally

**Why Tone is the "architecture":**
Tone is the **triangle** graphic in Advanced Imaging charts—it sits beneath Color and determines the **cognitive foundation**. Color (the hexagon) is the messenger that transfers Tone's information to the surface (Line level).

### Color: The Messenger

**Function:** Color is the **exit frequency** that transfers Tonal information from the internal Crystal architecture to the surface manifestation (Line level). Variables are calculated at the **Color level**.

**The Six Colors:**
**Color 1: Fear** (Investigation, Foundation)
**Color 2: Hope** (Possibility, Anticipation)
**Color 3: Desire** (Trajectory, Leader/Follower)
**Color 4: Need** (Master/Novice, Wanting)
**Color 5: Guilt** (Probability, Conditioner)
**Color 6: Innocence** (Observer, Detachment)

**How Color Manifests Across the Four Variables:**

**[[Determination]] (Design Sun/Earth):**
- Color 1: Appetite (Consecutive)
- Color 2: Taste (Restrictive)
- Color 3: Thirst (Hot/Cold)
- Color 4: Touch (Calm/Nervous)
- Color 5: Sound (High/Low)
- Color 6: Light (Direct/Indirect)

**[[Environment]] (Design Nodes):**
- Color 1: Caves (Security)
- Color 2: Markets (Exchange)
- Color 3: Kitchens (Transformation)
- Color 4: Mountains (Perspective)
- Color 5: Valleys (Flow)
- Color 6: Shores (Transition)

**[[Perspective]] (Personality Nodes):**
- Color 1: Fear (Investigation)
- Color 2: Hope (Possibility)
- Color 3: Desire (Leader/Follower)
- Color 4: Need (Master/Novice)
- Color 5: Guilt (Probability)
- Color 6: Innocence (Observer)

**[[Motivation]] (Personality Sun/Earth):**
- Color 1: Fear (Foundation/Security)
- Color 2: Hope (Anticipation)
- Color 3: Desire (Trajectory)
- Color 4: Need (Wanting)
- Color 5: Guilt (Conditioner)
- Color 6: Innocence (Detachment)

**The Pattern:** The same Color carries a **consistent archetypal quality** (Fear, Hope, Desire, Need, Guilt, Innocence) but manifests **differently** depending on the Variable (Determination, Environment, Perspective, Motivation).

**Why Color is the "messenger":**
Color is the **hexagon** graphic in Advanced Imaging charts—it sits between Tone (architecture) and Line (surface). It "translates" the Tonal frequency into practical expression.

## The Three Binaries: Tonal Cognition

### Splenic Binary (Tones 1-2): Survival Cognition

**Tone 1: Smell (Left)**
**Cognition:** Survival through **scent and instinctual recognition**
**Orientation:** Strategic—actively sniffing out danger, opportunity, or compatibility
**Historical Parallel:** The animal tracking predator/prey by scent; the perfumer identifying notes

**Tone 2: Taste (Right)**
**Cognition:** Survival through **selective intake and rejection**
**Orientation:** Receptive—passively tasting what enters, accepting or rejecting
**Historical Parallel:** The wine connoisseur discerning quality; the herbalist knowing which plants are medicine vs. poison

**The Binary:**
- **Smell (1)** is outward-focused—detecting what is "out there"
- **Taste (2)** is inward-focused—sensing what enters the system

**Connection to Determination:**
- Tones 1-2 underlie **Colors 1-2** (Appetite and Taste)
- These are the most **primitive** dietary regimens—consecutive eating (Color 1) and restrictive eating (Color 2)
- They operate through **Splenic intelligence**—instinctual, immune-based, survival-oriented

### Ajna Binary (Tones 3-4): Vision Cognition

**Tone 3: Outer Vision (Left)**
**Cognition:** Strategic, **action-oriented seeing**—looking outward to assess, plan, and act
**Orientation:** Strategic—binocular focus on external targets
**Historical Parallel:** The hunter tracking game; the general surveying the battlefield

**Tone 4: Inner Vision (Right)**
**Cognition:** Receptive, **meditative seeing**—looking inward or absorbing without focus
**Orientation:** Receptive—peripheral vision, contemplative depth
**Historical Parallel:** The meditator in stillness; the mystic receiving visions

**The Binary:**
- **Outer Vision (3)** is extraverted—seeing to act
- **Inner Vision (4)** is introverted—seeing to understand

**Connection to Determination:**
- Tones 3-4 underlie **Colors 3-4** (Thirst and Touch)
- These dietary regimens involve **temperature** (Color 3—hot/cold) and **atmosphere** (Color 4—calm/nervous)
- They operate through **Ajna intelligence**—conceptual, pattern-recognition, vision-based

### Solar Plexus Binary (Tones 5-6): Emotional/Sensory Cognition

**Tone 5: Feeling (Left)**
**Cognition:** **Active emotional/sensory processing**—feeling through engagement
**Orientation:** Strategic—leaning into sensations, actively feeling
**Historical Parallel:** The dancer embodying rhythm; the lover actively connecting

**Tone 6: Touch (Right)**
**Cognition:** **Receptive emotional/sensory absorption**—being touched by reality
**Orientation:** Receptive—allowing sensation to enter, passive touch
**Historical Parallel:** The empath absorbing atmosphere; the infant being held

**The Binary:**
- **Feeling (5)** is active—reaching out to touch
- **Touch (6)** is passive—being touched

**Connection to Determination:**
- Tones 5-6 underlie **Colors 5-6** (Sound and Light)
- These dietary regimens involve **acoustic frequency** (Color 5—high/low sound) and **solar timing** (Color 6—day/night)
- They operate through **Solar Plexus intelligence**—emotional, wave-based, sensory-oriented

## Left vs. Right: The 1781 Mutation

### The Visual Cortex Mutation

According to the Human Design revelation, a **mutation of the human visual cortex occurred in 1781**—the same year Uranus was discovered. This mutation divided humanity into two cognitive streams:

**Left (Strategic):**
- **Pre-1781 dominant** (though still present after)
- Focused, binocular vision
- Active, survival-oriented, competitive
- The "old way"—hunting, conquering, mastering

**Right (Receptive):**
- **Post-1781 emergent** (becoming dominant after 2027)
- Peripheral, unfocused vision
- Passive, deep-intake, receptive
- The "new way"—absorbing, witnessing, synthesizing vast fields

**The Transition:**
- 1781-2027: Overlap period—both Left and Right exist
- Post-2027: Right becomes majority in newborns
- By 2181: Right dominance fully established

**Implication for Tone:**
Your **Tone** (1, 3, 5 = Left; 2, 4, 6 = Right) determines which cognitive stream you belong to at the **foundational level**. This is **not** a choice or preference—it is fixed architecture.

### How Left/Right Manifests Across Variables

**Determination:**
- **Left:** Actively manages dietary regimen (e.g., Left Color 1 strategically eats consecutively)
- **Right:** Passively gravitates to dietary regimen (e.g., Right Color 1 instinctively rejects mixtures)

**Environment:**
- **Left:** Actively seeks and creates correct Environment (e.g., Left Color 1 designs Cave spaces)
- **Right:** Passively finds correct Environment (e.g., Right Color 1 instinctively gravitates to enclosed spaces)

**Perspective:**
- **Left:** Actively focuses and conceptualizes (e.g., Left Color 1 strategically investigates)
- **Right:** Passively absorbs and observes (e.g., Right Color 1 peripherally takes in foundational details)

**Motivation:**
- **Left:** Actively pursues driven by Motivation (e.g., Left Color 1 actively secures foundations)
- **Right:** Passively embodies Motivation (e.g., Right Color 1 naturally gravitates to security)

## Advanced PHS: Tone/Color/Base Diagnostic Imaging

### What is Advanced Imaging?

**Advanced Imaging** is the PHS diagnostic tool that reveals the **Tone/Color/Base** matrix of an individual's chart. It is used by certified PHS practitioners to prescribe precise dietary regimens.

**What it shows:**
- **Design Sun/Earth:** Tone, Color, Base (determines [[Determination]])
- **Design Nodes:** Tone, Color, Base (determines [[Environment]])
- **Personality Nodes:** Tone, Color, Base (determines [[Perspective]])
- **Personality Sun/Earth:** Tone, Color, Base (determines [[Motivation]])

**The Graphics:**
- **Triangle** = Tone (architecture)
- **Hexagon** = Color (messenger)
- **Square** = Base (entry)

### How Practitioners Use It

**Step 1: Identify the Color** (Determination)
- Example: Design Sun is Color 1 (Appetite - Consecutive)

**Step 2: Identify the Tone** (Left or Right)
- Example: Tone 3 (Outer Vision - Left)
- **Implication:** This person has **Left Tone 3 Color 1**—strategic, action-oriented cognition (Tone 3) with consecutive eating (Color 1)
- They will **actively manage** their consecutive diet (Left orientation)

**Step 3: Identify the Base** (Fine-tuning)
- Example: Base 2
- **Implication:** Advanced practitioners use Base to fine-tune the regimen—adjusting for specific environmental or constitutional factors
- This level of detail is rare and used only in specialized PHS consultations

**Step 4: Prescribe and Monitor**
- The practitioner prescribes the dietary regimen (e.g., "Eat one food at a time, actively managing your meals")
- The client experiments for **7 years** (the cycle of cellular regeneration)
- Sensory acuity, digestion, energy, and clarity are tracked

### Why Not DIY?

**Complexity:** The Tone/Color/Base matrix is intricate—misinterpreting it can lead to incorrect practice
**Expertise:** Certified PHS practitioners have trained for years in reading Advanced Imaging charts
**Experiment:** PHS is an experiment, not a prescription—professional guidance supports correct testing

**However:** If you have your Advanced Imaging chart and understand your Color, you **can** begin experimenting with [[Determination]] (dietary regimen) on your own, using [[Primary Health System]] guidelines.

## Tone, Color, Base and Differentiation

### The Promise of Substructure

The revelation of Tone/Color/Base was radical: **Consciousness has architecture**—it is not formless or arbitrary. The way you think, see, digest, and move is **mechanically structured** by the Crystals imprinted at birth.

**What this means:**
- You are **not** a blank slate
- Your cognition is **not** culturally constructed or developmentally flexible
- You are **designed** to operate in a specific way—Left or Right, Color 1 or Color 6, Tone 3 or Tone 5
- **Differentiation** = Aligning to your architecture, not conforming to collective norms

#### The Gift
When you live according to your Tone/Color/Base (via Variables), you access your **unique intelligence**—the gift you offer that no one else can replicate.

#### The Challenge
The Not-Self mind resists this. It wants to be "flexible," "adaptive," "open to anything." The truth is more radical: **You are fixed**. And in that fixedness lies your freedom.

## Shadows of Tone/Color/Base Study

### 1. Information Overload

**The Danger:** Obsessing over Tone/Color/Base complexity without living Strategy and [[Authority]].

**Example:** A person studying their Tone 3, Base 4, Color 1 matrix endlessly, analyzing every detail, without ever experimenting with their dietary regimen.

**Reality:** Tone/Color/Base is **background architecture**. It informs practice but does not replace it.

**Antidote:** Use Tone/Color/Base to understand **why** your Variables work the way they do, then **experiment** with the Variables themselves.

### 2. Mechanical Reductionism

**The Danger:** Treating Tone/Color/Base as deterministic fate—"I'm Tone 3, so I can't be receptive."

**Reality:** Tone determines **orientation** (Left or Right), not **capacity**. A Left being can still listen, absorb, or rest. A Right being can still act, focus, or pursue.

**Antidote:** Tone/Color/Base describes **natural orientation**, not rigid limits. Honor your design while remaining flexible in expression.

### 3. Elitism

**The Danger:** Using Tone/Color/Base knowledge to create hierarchy—"Right is more evolved" or "Left is superior."

**Reality:** **Neither Left nor Right is better**. The 1781 mutation is not a moral judgment—it is a mechanical shift. Both orientations are valid.

**Antidote:** Honor differentiation. Your architecture is unique, not superior.

## Correspondences

### Qabalah: The Tree of Life and Emanation

**Parallel:** The **Tree of Life** describes consciousness as **emanating** from formless Source (Ain Soph) through ten Sephiroth. Human Design's Tone/Color/Base describes consciousness as **entering** through neutrino streams and **structuring** through Crystals.

**Integration:** Both systems recognize **layered architecture**—consciousness is not monolithic but structured through levels (Kether → Malkuth in Qabalah; Base → Tone → Color → Line in Human Design).

### Vedic Philosophy: Kosha System

**Parallel:** The **Pancha Kosha** (five sheaths) in Vedic philosophy describes consciousness as layered:
1. **Annamaya Kosha** (physical body) = Line (surface manifestation)
2. **Pranamaya Kosha** (energy body) = Color (messenger frequency)
3. **Manomaya Kosha** (mental body) = Tone (architecture)
4. **Vijnanamaya Kosha** (wisdom body) = Base (entry)
5. **Anandamaya Kosha** (bliss body) = Crystal (consciousness itself)

**Integration:** Tone/Color/Base parallels the nested structure of consciousness in Vedic thought.

### Jungian Psychology: Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious

**Parallel:** Jung's **archetypes** are fixed patterns in the **collective unconscious**—inherited structures that shape experience. Tone/Color/Base are similar—fixed patterns in the **individual unconscious** (Design Crystal).

**Integration:** Archetypes are **collective**; Tone/Color/Base are **individual**. Both are mechanical, not developmental.
