# 8th House
*Death, Transformation, and the Underworld*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **8th House** governs **death and rebirth**—not physical death alone, but all processes of transformation that require **ego-death**. This is the house of inheritance, shared resources, sexuality as merger, and the psychological infrastructure beneath social performance. It is **Scorpio's domain**: the relentless excavation of truth, no matter the cost.

Where the 7th House is conscious partnership, the 8th House is **dissolution of boundaries**—the moment when two become one, when self surrenders to transformation, when control is relinquished and something new is born from the wreckage.

Lilly describes the 8th House as governing "death, wills, legacies, dowry or portion of the wife, fear, and anguish of mind."[^1]
