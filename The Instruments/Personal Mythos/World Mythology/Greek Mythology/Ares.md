# Ares
*Enyalios — God of Bloodlust, Raw Aggression, and the Chaos of War*

---

## Overview

**Ares** (Ἄρης, Roman: **Mars**) is the Olympian god of **war**—not strategic warfare, not noble victory, not honorable combat, but the **raw, chaotic, bloody violence of battle itself**. He is **bloodlust incarnate**, the rage that explodes when boundaries are violated, the aggression that kills without thought, the survival instinct that fights to the death. Where [[Athena]] represents **strategic warfare** (planning, discipline, victory through wisdom), Ares represents the **berserker fury**, the loss of self in combat, the exhilaration and horror of violence unleashed.

Son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]], Ares is **despised even among the gods**. Homer, in the *Iliad* (5.890), has Zeus say to Ares:

> *"To me you are the most hateful of all the gods who hold Olympus, for you are ever quarrelsome and love wars and battles. You have the intolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Hera... I can barely endure you."*

This rejection by his own father encodes Ares's essential nature: **he is necessary but unloved, powerful but dangerous, essential for survival but terrifying even to those who wield him**. Every culture needs warriors, needs the capacity for violence in defense of the tribe—but **no culture fully trusts the warrior**. Ares is the aspect of the psyche that can kill, that can rage, that can destroy—**and that capacity, once awakened, is never fully controllable**.

Unlike the **Roman Mars** (who was a respected god of the state, protector of Rome, patron of agriculture and ordered violence), **Greek Ares** is **chaotic, wild, often cowardly**. He is wounded easily (stabbed by Diomedes in the *Iliad*, captured by the Aloadae giants and imprisoned for over a year), he flees battle when hurt, he is mocked by other gods. Where Mars is **civilized violence** (the disciplined legion, the structured army, violence in service of the state), Ares is **primal violence** (the individual warrior lost in bloodlust, the mob, the riot, the murder).

Ares's epithets reveal his nature:
- **Enyalios** ("Warlike")—used interchangeably with Ares, emphasizing his role as war personified
- **Ares Theritas** ("Beastly Ares")—the animal fury, the loss of humanity in combat
- **Androklastes** ("Man-Slayer")—he does not discriminate, does not honor; he simply kills

Ares is attended by his sons **Phobos** (Fear) and **Deimos** (Terror)—personifications of the emotions war provokes. His sister is **Eris** (Discord, Strife), goddess of conflict who delights in chaos. When Ares enters battle, **blood flows, men scream, chaos reigns**. He does not care who wins—he cares only that violence is enacted, that rage finds expression, that the life force asserts itself through destruction.

From a Jungian perspective, Ares represents the **aggressive instinct**, the **shadow of violence**, the **capacity for rage and destruction that every psyche contains**. Jung writes:

> "The shadow is that hidden, repressed, for the most part inferior and guilt-laden personality... If it has been believed hitherto that the human shadow was the source of all evil, it can now be ascertained on closer investigation that the unconscious man, that is, his shadow, does not consist only of morally reprehensible tendencies, but also displays a number of good qualities, such as normal instincts, appropriate reactions, realistic insights, creative impulses, etc." (CW 9ii, ¶13-14).

Ares is **shadow**—denied, he becomes passive-aggression, resentment, the victim who secretly craves violence, the "nice person" who explodes in rage. **Integrated**, he is courage, self-defense, healthy assertion, the capacity to fight for what matters, to say "no" with force, to defend boundaries. The psyche without Ares collapses into passivity, is overrun by predators, becomes the eternal victim. **The psyche possessed by Ares becomes the berserker, the abuser, the one who destroys everything in rage**.

Ares's most famous relationship is his affair with **[[Aphrodite]]** (goddess of love and beauty). From their union were born **Harmonia** (Harmony—paradoxically, from the union of love and war), **Phobos and Deimos** (Fear and Terror), and in some traditions, **Eros** (desire itself born from beauty and aggression). This pairing encodes the **inseparability of eros and aggression, attraction and assertion, desire and violence**. To love is to risk conflict; to desire is to assert will; to connect is to risk the fury that comes when connection is threatened or betrayed.

## Archetypal Cast: Mythological Narratives and Divine Attributes

### The Affair with Aphrodite: Caught in the Golden Net

Ares's most famous myth is his adulterous affair with **[[Aphrodite]]**, goddess of love and beauty, who was married to **Hephaestus** (the lame smith-god).[^1] The affair encodes the union of **war and love, violence and beauty, aggression and desire**—the recognition that **eros and aggression are not opposites but companions, even lovers**.

Hephaestus, suspecting the affair, crafted an **invisible golden net** so fine it could not be seen or broken. He placed it over Aphrodite's bed, and when Ares and Aphrodite lay together, the net sprang shut, trapping them *in flagrante delicto*. Hephaestus summoned all the Olympians to witness the humiliation—**Beauty and War, naked and entwined, exposed to the gods' laughter**.

Homer describes the scene in the *Odyssey* (8.306-366). The goddesses (modestly) stayed away, but the male gods came and laughed—though [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]], gazing at Aphrodite's beauty, admitted they would gladly endure such shame to lie with her. [[Poseidon]] eventually persuaded Hephaestus to release them, offering to pay restitution if Ares fled without paying. Ares fled to **Thrace** (his homeland, a wild northern region associated with barbarism); Aphrodite fled to **Cyprus**, where she bathed and restored her radiance.

From the union of Ares and Aphrodite were born:
- **Harmonia** (Harmony)—goddess of concord, later married to Cadmus, founder of Thebes (paradoxically, harmony emerges from the union of opposites, from war and love reconciled)
- **Phobos** (Fear) and **Deimos** (Terror)—personifications of the emotions that war provokes, attendants of Ares on the battlefield
- **Eros** (in some traditions)—desire born from the union of beauty and aggression

**Archetypal Interpretation:**

The affair with Aphrodite encodes the **inseparability of love and aggression, eros and thanatos, desire and violence**. Freud identified these as the two fundamental drives: **eros** (the life instinct—union, creation, connection) and **thanatos** (the death instinct—dissolution, aggression, destruction). Ares and Aphrodite, entwined in bed, represent **both forces at once**—to love is to be vulnerable to violence; to desire is to assert will; to connect is to risk the fury that comes when connection is threatened or lost.

The children of the affair reveal this duality: **Harmonia** (concord, peace, balance) emerges from the union of war and love, but so do **Phobos and Deimos** (fear and terror). Love creates harmony, but it also creates the conditions for fear—**the more we love, the more we have to lose, the more vulnerable we are to violation**. Ares guards what Aphrodite makes precious; Aphrodite softens what Ares makes hard. They need each other.

The golden net and public exposure encode the **humiliation of being caught in the act of passion and aggression**. Hephaestus's revenge is not violence (he does not fight Ares)—it is **exposure**, making visible what should be private, revealing the lovers at their most vulnerable. The gods laugh, but they also **envy**—Hermes and Apollo admit they would endure the same shame for the same pleasure. This suggests that **desire and aggression, though humiliating when exposed, are worth the risk**. To be fully human is to be capable of both—to love fiercely, to fight fiercely, to refuse the domestication that demands we be either gentle or violent, never both.

Psychologically, the myth reveals that **the anima (Aphrodite) and the aggressive instinct (Ares) are lovers**. The soul-image and the warrior are not enemies—they are **in bed together**. The man who loves deeply will also fight fiercely to protect what he loves. The woman who desires passionately will also rage when her desire is thwarted or violated. **To deny the Ares within is to weaken the capacity for authentic eros; to deny Aphrodite is to turn aggression into mere destruction, violence divorced from life**.

### Ares in the Trojan War: Wounded and Humiliated

In Homer's *Iliad*, Ares fights for the **Trojans** (motivated by his love for Aphrodite, who also favors Troy). But Ares in the *Iliad* is **not a noble warrior**—he is chaotic, reckless, and easily wounded. In Book 5, the Greek hero **Diomedes**, aided by [[Athena]], **stabs Ares with his spear**. Ares screams in pain—his cry is described as loud as the shouts of **nine or ten thousand men in battle**—and flees to **Olympus**, where he complains to Zeus:

> *"Father Zeus, do you not chafe to see these violent deeds? We gods are ever suffering the most lamentable things by each other's hands... You begot this mad and baleful daughter [Athena], whose mind is ever set on iniquity" (Iliad 5.872-880).*

Zeus rebukes him:

> *"Do not sit beside me and whine, you double-faced rogue. To me you are the most hateful of all the gods who hold Olympus, for you are ever quarrelsome and love wars and battles. You have the intolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Hera, whom I can barely control... Nevertheless, I will not suffer you to be in pain any longer, for you are my child" (Iliad 5.889-898).*

Hephaestus heals Ares, but the humiliation remains: **the god of war, wounded by a mortal, fleeing in pain, rebuked by his father**. This is not the invincible warrior—this is the shadow of war, the reality behind the glory.

**Archetypal Interpretation:**

Ares's wounding and humiliation encode the **vulnerability of raw aggression when confronted by strategic intelligence** (Athena). Diomedes, aided by Athena, can wound Ares because **he fights with discipline, with divine guidance, with strategy**. Ares, fighting in pure bloodlust, is predictable, reckless, easily exploited. This reveals that **unmediated aggression is not invincible—it is vulnerable, wounded by cleverness, undone by discipline**.

Psychologically, this warns against **identifying with rage, with the berserker state, with pure aggression**. The ego possessed by Ares believes itself invincible—**"I am strong, I am powerful, I will destroy all who oppose me"**—but this inflation leads to wounding. The person who cannot control their rage, who explodes in violence, who attacks without thinking, **will be wounded by those who are calmer, more strategic, more integrated**.

Zeus's rebuke ("you are the most hateful of all gods") encodes the **father's rejection of the son's violence**. Zeus himself is violent (he overthrew his father Kronos, he rapes mortal women, he wields the thunderbolt), but **he disowns Ares's violence as crude, chaotic, uncontrolled**. This is the generational dynamic: **the father uses violence to establish order, then condemns the son for inheriting that same violence**. Zeus can barely endure Ares—he is necessary (Zeus needs war to maintain his rule) but despised (Zeus wants civilized violence, not chaotic bloodlust).

For men, this encodes the **internalized father who rejects the son's aggression**—"Don't fight, don't be violent, control yourself"—while simultaneously modeling violence and benefiting from it. The son learns: **aggression is essential for success (Zeus rules through force) but shameful to express (Ares is hated for embodying that force)**. The result is split: aggression is pushed into shadow, emerging as passive-aggression, resentment, or explosive rage when the ego's control breaks.

### The Areopagus: Trial for Justified Violence

The **Areopagus** ("Hill of Ares") in Athens was the site of Ares's trial by the gods. **Halirrhothius**, son of [[Poseidon]], attempted to rape **Alcippe**, daughter of Ares and the nymph Aglauros. Ares, discovering the assault, **killed Halirrhothius** on the spot. Poseidon demanded justice, and the gods convened the first homicide trial at the hill that would bear Ares's name.

The gods, after hearing the case, **acquitted Ares**—establishing the principle that **violence in defense of one's own is justified**. The Areopagus became Athens's court for homicide cases, and the myth encodes the legal and moral recognition that **not all violence is unjust; some violence is defense, protection, righteous rage**.

**Archetypal Interpretation:**

The Areopagus myth encodes the **legitimacy of defensive aggression**. Ares is acquitted because he acted to **defend his daughter from sexual violence**—he did not kill out of bloodlust or ambition, but out of paternal protection. This establishes that **there is a difference between aggression as predation (Halirrhothius's assault) and aggression as defense (Ares's killing)**.

Psychologically, this myth grants **permission for healthy aggression**—the capacity to say "no" with force, to defend boundaries, to fight when fighting is necessary. The psyche that has integrated Ares can **kill the rapist** (literally or metaphorically)—can destroy what violates, can rage against injustice, can fight to protect what is sacred. This is not berserker rage—it is **righteous anger, protective fury, the aggression that serves life rather than death**.

The trial (rather than automatic condemnation or automatic approval) suggests that **violence must be evaluated contextually**. Not all violence is justified (predatory violence, sadistic violence, violence for pleasure is condemned). Not all violence is condemned (defensive violence, protective violence, violence in service of justice is honored). The work of integration requires **discernment**—knowing when to fight and when to restrain, when to unleash Ares and when to hold him back.

### Bound by the Aloadae: Ares Imprisoned

The twin giants **Otus and Ephialtes** (the **Aloadae**), sons of Poseidon, grew at an astonishing rate—nine inches per month—and by age nine were enormous and powerful. They declared war on the Olympians, piling **Mount Ossa on Olympus** and **Mount Pelion on Ossa** to reach the heavens. They captured **Ares** and **imprisoned him in a bronze jar** for **thirteen months** (one lunar year plus one month).

Ares would have perished (or suffered indefinitely) had not the giants' stepmother, **Eriboea**, informed [[Hermes]], who **rescued Ares** (already exhausted and nearly dead). The giants were eventually killed by [[Apollo]] or [[Artemis]] (depending on the version).

**Archetypal Interpretation:**

Ares's capture and imprisonment encode the **vulnerability of raw aggression when confronted by overwhelming force or when trapped, contained, unable to move**. The bronze jar is the ultimate containment—no light, no movement, no air, no expression. Ares, bound, cannot rage, cannot fight, cannot assert. He is **helpless, nearly dead, rescued only by the trickster ([[Hermes]])**.

Psychologically, this represents **aggression suppressed, bound, imprisoned by forces stronger than it**. When the superego, the collective, or external authority says *"You must not be angry, you must not fight, you must contain yourself"*—and enforces that demand with overwhelming force—the aggressive instinct is **stuffed into a bronze jar**, locked away, starved. The person becomes passive, compliant, unable to assert, unable to defend, unable to fight even when fighting is necessary.

But imprisoned aggression does not disappear—**it suffocates, it festers, it waits**. When finally released (often by a trickster energy—Hermes, the unconscious, the slip that reveals the rage), it erupts **starved, desperate, nearly dead but still deadly**. The person who has imprisoned their Ares for years may explode in violence that shocks everyone (including themselves)—**"I never knew I was capable of this"**—because the rage, denied sunlight and exercise, has become monstrous.

The rescue by Hermes suggests that **the trickster, the mediator, the psychopomp is essential for releasing trapped aggression**. Therapy, humor, art, indirect expression—these are Hermetic strategies for releasing Ares from the bronze jar without letting him destroy everything. **You cannot leave him imprisoned (you will suffocate), but you cannot simply open the jar and let him loose (he will rampage)**. You need a guide, a trickster, a way to bring him out slowly, to feed him, to let him recover strength without overwhelming the ego.

### The Amazons: Daughters of Ares

The **Amazons**—a mythical tribe of warrior women—were said to be daughters of Ares. They lived in all-female societies, trained in combat, rode horses, wielded bows and swords, and fought as fiercely as any male warrior. They were said to cut off or burn their right breasts to better draw the bow (though this is likely Greek male fantasy; no archaeological evidence supports it). Famous Amazons include:

- **Hippolyta** — Queen of the Amazons, owner of a magical girdle given by Ares; Heracles's Ninth Labor was to retrieve it
- **Penthesilea** — Amazon queen who fought at Troy, killed by Achilles (who mourned her beauty after slaying her)
- **Antiope/Hippolyta** (conflated in some traditions) — Abducted by Theseus, mother of Hippolytus

The Amazons embodied **feminine aggression, women who fight, women who refuse domestication**—a threatening concept to patriarchal Greek culture, which preferred women to be passive, domestic, controlled. The Amazon myths often end with the warrior woman defeated, killed, or married off (domesticated)—**the patriarchal fantasy of taming the wild woman warrior**.

**Archetypal Interpretation:**

The Amazons as daughters of Ares encode **feminine aggression, the woman who fights, the anima as warrior**. In patriarchal mythology, the warrior is coded masculine (Ares, Athena in male armor)—the Amazon disrupts this by being **feminine and fierce, beautiful and deadly, woman and warrior at once**.

For women, the Amazon archetype offers the model of **the woman who does not need a man to protect her, who can fight her own battles, who wields aggression as her birthright**. She is not [[Artemis]] (the virgin huntress who avoids men) but the warrior who **fights men on equal terms** (or defeats them).

For men, the Amazon represents the **anima as aggressor, the feminine Other who fights back, the woman who is not passive, not conquerable, not safe**. The Greek male response to the Amazon is fascination and fear—**she must be defeated, killed, or married** (domesticated, brought under patriarchal control). This reveals the patriarchal terror of **feminine power, feminine rage, the woman who says "no" with a sword**.

The healing work for women requires **reclaiming the Amazon, the daughter of Ares, the right to fight, to rage, to be fierce without apology**. The healing work for men requires **meeting the Amazon without needing to defeat her, allowing the anima to be fierce, honoring the woman who fights back rather than demanding she submit**.

## Jungian Analysis: The Aggressive Instinct and the Shadow of Violence

### Ares as the Aggressive Instinct: Essential and Dangerous

Carl Jung identified **aggression** as one of the fundamental instincts, essential for survival, individuation, and the assertion of self. Yet aggression is also deeply problematic—**it is the instinct that harms, that kills, that destroys**. Jung writes:

> "Aggression... is a natural instinct, and as such, it is morally neutral. It becomes good or evil depending on how it is used... The individual who cannot assert himself, who cannot fight, who cannot say 'no,' who collapses into passivity—this individual has lost contact with the aggressive instinct and is at the mercy of the world" (CW 10, ¶ 853).

Ares represents **raw, unmediated aggression**—not the strategic violence of [[Athena]] (disciplined, intelligent, purposeful), but the **berserker fury, the survival instinct, the body as weapon, the self defending itself without thought**. This aggression is:

- **Necessary for survival** — Without Ares, the psyche is defenseless, overrun, unable to set boundaries, unable to protect itself from predators (internal or external)
- **Dangerous when uncontrolled** — Ares possessed, the psyche becomes the abuser, the tyrant, the one who destroys everything in rage, who cannot soften, who sees every interaction as battle
- **Morally neutral** — Aggression is not inherently good or evil; it is a tool, an instinct, a capacity. It becomes righteous (Areopagus, defending one's own) or destructive (bloodlust, sadism, cruelty) depending on context and integration

The psyche **without Ares** collapses into:
- **Passivity** — Unable to assert, unable to fight, unable to defend boundaries
- **Victim identity** — "I am powerless, I cannot protect myself, the world is dangerous and I am helpless"
- **Passive-aggression** — Aggression denied direct expression becomes indirect, manipulative, sabotaging (the "nice person" who undermines, who gossips, who punishes through withdrawal)
- **Resentment** — Accumulated rage that has no outlet, festering into bitterness, envy, the desire to see others fail

The psyche **possessed by Ares** becomes:
- **The berserker** — Lost in rage, unable to stop fighting, unable to distinguish friend from foe
- **The abuser** — Using aggression to dominate, control, terrorize others
- **The addict of conflict** — Needing to fight, needing enemies, unable to rest, always at war
- **The destroyer** — Violence for its own sake, cruelty, sadism, the refusal to build, only to tear down

The work of individuation requires **integrating Ares**—neither denying him (collapsing into passivity) nor being possessed by him (becoming the berserker). Integration means:
- **Knowing when to fight and when to restrain** — Discernment, context, strategic use of aggression rather than blind rage
- **Healthy assertion** — Saying "no," defending boundaries, standing one's ground without needing to destroy the other
- **Channeling aggression into productive forms** — Sport, art, work, activism, the capacity to fight *for* something rather than simply against
- **Allowing anger without being ruled by it** — Feeling rage, expressing it, then letting it pass rather than identifying with it permanently

### The Warrior Archetype: Initiation and Discipline

The **warrior** is one of the universal archetypes, present in every culture's mythology and initiation rites. Unlike Ares (raw, chaotic aggression), the **mature warrior** is:
- **Disciplined** — Trained, controlled, capable of restraint even in battle
- **Purposeful** — Fights for a cause, for protection, for justice—not for bloodlust
- **Honorable** — Follows codes, respects enemies, does not kill unnecessarily
- **Sacrificial** — Willing to die for what he protects, for the tribe, for the sacred

Ares is the **pre-initiation warrior**, the berserker, the adolescent rage that has not yet been disciplined by training, purpose, or sacrifice. In traditional warrior initiations (found in indigenous cultures, martial traditions, military rites), the young man's **raw aggression (Ares) is channeled into disciplined warriorship** through:

1. **Physical ordeal** — Testing endurance, pain tolerance, the body's limits (the warrior learns he can survive what he fears)
2. **Training in skill** — Learning technique, strategy, discipline (Athena's influence)
3. **Confronting death** — Facing mortality, accepting that the warrior may die, releasing the ego's demand for invincibility
4. **Service to the tribe** — The warrior fights not for himself but for the community, the family, the sacred (aggression in service of life, not death)

Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette, in *King, Warrior, Magician, Lover* (1990), identify the **Warrior** as one of the four mature masculine archetypes. The mature Warrior is characterized by:
- **Clear boundaries** — Knows where he ends and others begin, defends boundaries without violating others'
- **Aggressiveness in service of good** — Fights for justice, protection, the sacred (not for ego, not for conquest)
- **Disciplined action** — Acts decisively, without hesitation, but also without unnecessary cruelty
- **Transpersonal commitment** — Serves something beyond himself (the king, the cause, the sacred, the tribe)

The **shadow Warrior** manifests as:
- **The Sadist** (active shadow) — Enjoys cruelty, uses violence for pleasure, tortures and dominates for the thrill of power
- **The Masochist** (passive shadow) — Invites punishment, collapses under attack, identifies as victim, passive submission

Ares alone is not the mature Warrior—he is the **raw material** from which the Warrior is forged. To become a true warrior requires **initiating the Ares energy, disciplining it, channeling it into purpose, restraining it from sadism and cruelty**.

### Ares and Aphrodite: The Mars-Venus Conjunction

The union of Ares and Aphrodite encodes the **inseparability of desire and aggression, eros and assertion, attraction and pursuit**. In astrology, **Mars and Venus** (the planets corresponding to Ares and Aphrodite) represent the fundamental polarity of **masculine and feminine**, **yang and yin**, **assertive and receptive**:

- **Mars** (Ares) — Assertion, penetration, pursuit, aggression, the yang principle, the outward thrust of energy
- **Venus** (Aphrodite) — Receptivity, attraction, beauty, desire, the yin principle, the inward pull of magnetism

When Mars and Venus are **in aspect** (conjunction, square, opposition) in a natal chart, the person experiences the **dynamic tension between assertion and receptivity, between fighting and loving, between aggression and desire**. This can manifest as:

- **Passion** — Intense desire, fierce attraction, the capacity to love and fight with equal intensity
- **Conflict in relationship** — Arguments as foreplay, the inability to separate desire from conflict, "I hate you / I love you"
- **Sexual energy** — High libido, the merging of aggression and eros in sexuality (dominance/submission dynamics, primal sexuality)
- **Creative force** — The union of assertive will (Mars) and aesthetic beauty (Venus) creates art, poetry, music that is both fierce and beautiful

The shadow of the Mars-Venus conjunction is **conflating love with violence**—believing that passion requires conflict, that desire requires domination, that to love is to fight. This manifests as:
- **Domestic violence** — "I hit you because I love you," aggression justified as passion
- **Toxic relationships** — Drama, volatility, the confusion of intensity with intimacy
- **Sadomasochism** (when unhealthy) — Confusing pain with pleasure, violence with connection, domination with love

The healing work requires **separating Ares and Aphrodite when necessary**—recognizing that **love does not require violence, desire does not require aggression, passion does not require pain**. Yet their union also teaches that **healthy relationships require both eros and assertion, both desire and boundaries, both softness and strength**. To love well, you must also be able to fight well (defend boundaries, assert needs, confront injustice). To fight well, you must also be able to love (soften, connect, value what you protect).

## Shadow Dynamics: Berserker Rage, Sadism, and the Victim Who Craves Violence

### The Berserker: Possessed by Rage

Ares's primary manifestation is the **berserker**—the warrior lost in bloodlust, unable to distinguish friend from foe, killing without thought until he is killed or until the rage exhausts itself. The Old Norse **berserkir** (bear-shirts) were warriors who fought in ecstatic fury, biting their shields, immune to pain, unstoppable until they collapsed.

The berserker state is **possession by Ares**—the ego dissolves, consciousness is overtaken by rage, and the body becomes pure weapon. This state is:

- **Useful in battle** — The berserker does not hesitate, does not fear, does not feel pain (until after the rage passes)
- **Dangerous to everyone** — The berserker cannot be controlled, cannot be reasoned with, cannot stop until the energy is exhausted
- **Impossible to integrate into civilian life** — The person who has been possessed by the berserker carries that capacity within them; it can erupt at any trigger (veterans with PTSD, domestic abusers, the "nice person" who explodes in terrifying rage)

Psychologically, the berserker is the **ego overwhelmed by the aggressive instinct**, unable to mediate, unable to restrain. The person identifies entirely with rage—**"I am my anger, I am the destroyer"**—and loses all other aspects of self. This is not healthy aggression (which can be controlled, directed, stopped when necessary)—this is **possession, the ego's abdication to the shadow**.

The healing work requires **acknowledging the berserker within without being ruled by him**. The person must learn:
- **To recognize the escalation before the berserker takes over** — Anger signals (body tension, heart rate, tunnel vision) that precede the explosion
- **To create space between trigger and response** — Pausing, breathing, stepping away before the rage possesses
- **To discharge aggression safely** — Physical exertion, hitting a punching bag, primal scream, movement that allows the energy to move without harming others
- **To seek the wound beneath the rage** — Often, berserker rage is defense against deeper vulnerability (fear, shame, grief, helplessness)

### Sadism and Cruelty: Violence for Pleasure

Ares's most disturbing shadow is **sadism**—violence for its own sake, cruelty that delights in suffering, the enjoyment of domination and pain. The sadist is not fighting to defend, not raging in heat of passion—the sadist is **cold, calculating, enjoying the act of harming**.

This shadow manifests as:
- **Physical abuse** — Hitting, beating, torturing for the pleasure of power, for the thrill of causing pain
- **Psychological abuse** — Humiliating, degrading, terrorizing others to feel superior, to enjoy their fear
- **War crimes** — Torture, rape as weapon, massacre of civilians, violence that goes beyond military necessity into cruelty
- **The tyrant** — Using violence to dominate, to terrorize, to ensure submission through fear

The sadist is Ares without Aphrodite, without Athena, without any moderating principle—**pure aggression divorced from life, from connection, from purpose**. The healing work (if possible—some sadists are unredeemable) requires:

- **Confronting the wound that created the sadist** — Often, the sadist was once a victim, was helpless, was humiliated; the sadism is the attempt to never be helpless again by becoming the one who inflicts rather than receives
- **Developing empathy** — Feeling the suffering of the Other, recognizing shared humanity, refusing to dehumanize
- **Channeling aggression into protection rather than predation** — Using strength to defend the vulnerable rather than to dominate them

### The Victim Who Craves Violence: Passive-Aggression and Resentment

When Ares is denied, suppressed, imprisoned (like in the bronze jar), he does not disappear—**he goes into shadow, emerging as passive-aggression, resentment, and the victim who secretly craves violence**.

This shadow manifests as:
- **Passive-aggression** — "I'm fine" (said through clenched teeth), silent treatment, sabotage, gossip, undermining
- **Resentment** — Accumulated rage with no outlet, festering into bitterness, envy, the desire to see others fail
- **Victim identity** — "Everyone hurts me, I am helpless, the world is cruel" (refusing to fight, refusing to assert, identifying as powerless)
- **Vicarious violence** — Enjoying violence in media (films, games, news) as substitute for direct expression, identifying with aggressors while consciously identifying as victim
- **Projection** — Seeing others as aggressive, hostile, dangerous while denying one's own aggression

The victim who craves violence is **Ares imprisoned, starving, desperate**. The person cannot acknowledge their own rage (because the superego, the collective, or trauma has taught them *"anger is dangerous, violence is evil, you must never fight"*), so they **split off aggression into shadow**. But the instinct remains, and it finds expression indirectly.

The healing work requires:
- **Acknowledging the rage** — "Yes, I am angry. Yes, I want to fight. Yes, I have aggression within me."
- **Giving aggression safe expression** — Physical movement, martial arts, hitting a pillow, primal sound work, anything that allows the energy to move
- **Reclaiming the right to defend** — "I am allowed to say 'no.' I am allowed to set boundaries. I am allowed to fight when fighting is necessary."
- **Releasing victim identity** — Moving from "I am helpless" to "I have power, I can assert, I can defend myself"

## Practical Application: Working with the Ares Archetype

### Invocations and Rituals

**To invoke Ares for courage and assertion:**
- Stand in warrior stance (feet apart, grounded, arms ready). Visualize yourself as warrior. Speak: *"Ares, god of war, grant me courage. Let me defend what I love. Let me assert without apology. Let me fight when fighting is necessary. I am not passive, I am not helpless—I am fierce."*
- Use before confrontation, difficult conversation, or moment requiring assertion.

**To invoke Ares for healthy aggression:**
- Physical exertion: run, hit a punching bag, lift weights, practice martial arts. As you move, speak: *"Ares, I honor your energy. I channel aggression into strength, into discipline, into purpose. I am warrior, not berserker. I fight for what matters, not for bloodlust."*

**To integrate the Ares shadow (rage, violence, passive-aggression):**
- Identify where you have denied your aggression. Ask: *Where have I been too passive? Where have I failed to defend myself or others? Where does my rage live, hidden?*
- Visualize releasing Ares from the bronze jar. Speak: *"I acknowledge the warrior within. I am capable of violence. I am capable of rage. I do not deny this, but I will not be ruled by it. I am fierce and controlled, strong and compassionate, warrior and human."*

### Dream Work

Ares often appears in dreams as:
- War, battle, combat, violence, blood
- Weapons (swords, spears, guns, fists)
- Warriors, soldiers, fighters, attackers
- The color red, blood, fire
- Being attacked, defending, fighting back
- Rage, fury, berserker state

If Ares appears in your dreams, ask:
- **What am I fighting?** What enemy, internal or external, am I confronting?
- **Am I defending or attacking?** Is my aggression defensive (healthy) or predatory (shadow)?
- **Am I empowered or helpless?** Do I fight back, or am I overwhelmed?
- **What needs protection?** What am I defending—a person, a value, a boundary?

### Shadow Integration

To integrate Ares's shadow:
- **Practice healthy assertion** — Say "no" when you mean no. Set boundaries. Defend what matters. Stand your ground.
- **Discharge aggression safely** — Physical exertion, martial arts, primal movement, screaming into a pillow, hitting a punching bag.
- **Examine passive-aggression** — Notice when you withdraw, when you sabotage, when you undermine rather than confronting directly. Choose direct assertion instead.
- **Channel aggression into purpose** — Fight for justice, for the vulnerable, for a cause. Aggression in service of life is transformed.
- **Allow anger without identifying with it** — Feel rage, express it, then let it pass. You are not your anger; you *have* anger.
