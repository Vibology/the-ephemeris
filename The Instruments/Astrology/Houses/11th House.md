# 11th House
*Friendship, Hope, and the Collective Vision*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **11th House** governs **friendship** and **collective belonging**—not tribe (4th House) or contract (7th House), but **chosen community**. This is the house of hope, future vision, and the networks that transcend individual ego. It is **Aquarius's domain**: the recognition that individuality serves the whole.

Where the 10th House achieves public authority, the 11th House **distributes that achievement** to the collective. Where the 5th House creates for personal joy, the 11th House **offers that creation to the community**. The 11th House is not solitary; it is collaborative, networked, future-oriented.

Lilly describes the 11th House as governing "friends, friendship, hope, trust, confidence, praise, and the fidelity of friends."[^1]
