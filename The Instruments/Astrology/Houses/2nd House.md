# 2nd House
*Resources and the Ground of Value*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **2nd House** governs **resources and values**—not just money, but everything that sustains life: food, shelter, possessions, and the **sense of worth** that allows one to claim material security. This is the house of **having**: what you own, what you value, and whether you believe you deserve it.

Where the 1st House is **being** ("I am"), the 2nd House is **grounding** ("I have"). It answers the question: What supports my existence, and do I trust that it will continue?

Lilly describes the 2nd House as governing "wealth and poverty, the moveable goods of man, money lent, profit or gain, loss, and assistants in suits of law."[^1]
