# Pillar of Mercy
*The Right Pillar — Force, Expansion, Masculine*

---

## Overview

The **Pillar of Mercy** (Hebrew: עמוד החסד, *Ammud ha-Chesed*) is the right-hand column of the [[The Tree of Life]], containing the Sephiroth that embody expansive, merciful, and active qualities. It represents **force without form** — the outpouring, creative, overflowing energy that must be balanced by the restrictive containment of the [[Pillar of Severity]] (left) and reconciled through the [[Middle Pillar]] (center).

In the Zohar, this pillar is called the **Pillar of Force** and associated with the principle of **anabolism** — building up, expanding, increasing. It is the "right hand of God" that gives without measure.[^1]

## The Three Sephiroth

| Sephirah | Name | Number | Quality | Planet | Divine Name |
|----------|------|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| [[Chokmah]] | Wisdom | 2 | Supernal Father, pure creative impulse | Zodiac (fixed stars) | YHVH |
| [[Chesed]] | Mercy | 4 | Benevolence, abundance, kingly generosity | Jupiter | El |
| [[Netzach]] | Victory | 7 | Desire, passion, creative instinct, beauty | Venus | YHVH Tzabaoth |

The three Sephiroth descend from the Supernal level (Chokmah) through the Ethical (Chesed) to the Astral (Netzach), each expressing the mercy principle at a different octave:

- **Chokmah** is mercy as *primordial creative force* — the seed that contains all potential
- **Chesed** is mercy as *kingly generosity* — the conscious choice to give, build, and establish
- **Netzach** is mercy as *desire and instinct* — the emotional, artistic, erotic drive toward beauty and union

## Zoharic Associations

The Zohar assigns patriarchal and elemental correspondences to each pillar:

| Attribute | Pillar of Mercy |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Patriarch** | Abraham — the archetype of hospitality, who welcomed strangers and argued with God for mercy toward Sodom[^2] |
| **Color** | White — purity, radiance, unlimited giving |
| **Element** | Water — flowing, nourishing, overflowing its banks |
| **Direction** | South (in some traditions Right) |
| **Quality** | *Chesed* — loving-kindness, grace |

Abraham represents the pillar's essence: a giving so absolute it makes no distinctions. He welcomed three strangers (Genesis 18) without knowing they were angels, offered hospitality before asking questions, and pleaded for mercy even toward the wicked. This is force without form — love before judgment, generosity before assessment.

## Jachin: The Temple Pillar

The Pillar of Mercy corresponds to **Jachin** (יכין, "He shall establish"), the right-hand pillar at the entrance to Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 7:21).[^3] Together with **Boaz** ([[Pillar of Severity]]), the two pillars framed the threshold of the Holy Place — the boundary between the profane and the sacred.

Jachin represents the principle that God *establishes* — builds, founds, supports. It is the affirmative pillar: "Yes, this shall be." The aspirant who passes through the Temple enters between two principles: the affirmation of Jachin (expansion) and the testing of Boaz (severity).

## The Danger of Unbalanced Mercy

Mercy without severity is not mercy but **indulgence**. The Pillar of Mercy, when unbalanced by the Pillar of Severity, produces:

- **Formlessness** — Creative energy that never crystallizes into anything definite
- **Inflation** — The ego swelling with uncritical self-acceptance (cf. [[Inflation]])
- **Permissiveness** — Tolerance that enables harm by refusing to draw boundaries
- **Sentimentality** — Emotion without discernment, feeling without thought

The Zohar teaches that even Chesed must be "sweetened" by Geburah — unlimited giving must be tempered by the wisdom to withhold. A parent who gives everything and denies nothing is not merciful but negligent. The right pillar needs the left.

## Jungian Parallels

The Pillar of Mercy corresponds to the **expansive, outward-moving** dimension of psychic energy:

- The **persona** in its healthy aspect — the capacity to present oneself to the world, to engage, to *give* one's gifts
- The **extraversion function** — energy flowing outward toward objects, relationships, possibilities
- The **animus** in its positive aspect (in Jungian usage) — the creative, initiating, meaning-giving impulse

When this pillar dominates without the Pillar of Severity's counterbalance, the result is what Jung identified as **positive inflation** — the ego inflated with archetypal energy, believing itself to be the source of the creativity flowing through it rather than its vessel.[^4]

## Notes

[^1]: Wang, *The Qabalistic Tarot* — The Pillar of Mercy as the Pillar of Force, representing anabolism (building up) and expansive energy.

[^2]: Zohar — Abraham as the patriarch of the right pillar, associated with Chesed, white, and water. Genesis 18 (hospitality to strangers) and Genesis 18:23-33 (pleading for Sodom) as archetypes of unlimited mercy.

[^3]: 1 Kings 7:21 — "He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple; the pillar on the right he named Jachin, and the pillar on the left he named Boaz."

[^4]: Jung, CW 7 (*Two Essays on Analytical Psychology*) — Inflation as the identification of ego with archetypal content, the "mana personality" inflated with transpersonal energy.
