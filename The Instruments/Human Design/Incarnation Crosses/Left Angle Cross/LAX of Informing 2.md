# Left Angle Cross of Informing (2)

## Gates: 47/22/12/11 | Quarter of Duality

### Ra's Keynote
> "People with social skills who use the past to inspire, to turn people's attention toward the plight of those who are oppressed; this is informing as an art."[^1]

## The Four Gates

### Personality Sun: Gate 47 - Oppression (Realization)
**Center:** Ajna | **Circuitry:** Collective (Understanding Circuit)

Gate 47 is the **pressure to make sense of experience through mental realization**—the capacity to process the past until meaning emerges. As the Personality Sun, this defines the conscious purpose: to be the one who realizes, who finds clarity through the pressure of contemplation. In this Left Angle Cross, this realization serves as the content that must be shared.

### Personality Earth: Gate 22 - Grace (Openness)
**Center:** Solar Plexus | **Circuitry:** Individual (Knowing Circuit)

Gate 22 grounds the mental realization with **emotional grace and social openness**. The Earth position reveals that informing requires not just insight but the social skill to deliver it—the emotional intelligence that makes difficult truths receivable. Without grace, realization remains isolated; with grace, it transforms.

### Design Sun: Gate 12 - Standstill (Caution)
**Center:** Throat | **Circuitry:** Individual (Knowing Circuit)

Gate 12 operates unconsciously as **the mutative voice of caution**—the capacity for discerning articulation that knows when to speak and when to wait. This provides the trans-personal destiny with its mode of expression: informing that is artful rather than compulsive, that honors timing rather than forcing transmission.

### Design Earth: Gate 11 - Peace (Ideas)
**Center:** Ajna | **Circuitry:** Individual (Knowing Circuit)

Gate 11 grounds the voice of caution with **the mind full of ideas seeking expression**. This unconscious resource ensures that the artful informer has content to share—mutative concepts that can inspire, illuminate, and redirect attention.

## Cross Theme

The **LAX of Informing (2)** in the Quarter of Duality carries the archetype of the **artful advocate**—one whose trans-personal karma involves using mental realization (47) and emotional grace (22) to inform through discerning articulation (12) and mutative ideas (11).

This is a **Left Angle Cross**, meaning the individual carries a **trans-personal destiny**—their life path is fundamentally intertwined with others in karmic ways. The Informing (2) differs from Informing (1) in its emphasis on social artistry: where Informing (1) mutates through teaching, Informing (2) inspires through advocacy.

**Profiles:** 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3—all carrying the projective quality of the 5th line or the role-model potential of the 6th line.

This cross bridges two streams:
- **Collective Understanding** (47): The mental pressure to realize meaning from the past
- **Individual Knowing** (22/12/11): The emotional grace, cautious voice, and ideas of mutation

In the Quarter of Duality (Bonding), this Informing fulfills purpose through:
- The relationships that authorize the advocacy
- The bonds formed around shared awareness of oppression
- The partnerships that enable the artful delivery of difficult truths
- The recognition that informing is ultimately connecting

## Quarter Context

**Quarter of Duality | Realm of Jupiter | Purpose through Bonding**

In this quarter, the Informing fulfills its trans-personal purpose through **the bonds formed around shared insight**. Jupiter's expansive influence means that the awareness shared ripples outward, creating networks of those who now see what they could not see before. The individual is not merely an informer but a connector—linking people to causes, to each other, to purpose.

Ra's keynote emphasizes "turning people's attention toward the plight of those who are oppressed." This is informing in service of justice, using social skills (Gate 22) to make visible what has been hidden, using realization (Gate 47) to articulate what has been felt but not understood. This is advocacy as trans-personal calling.

## Shadow Expression

- **Mental martyrdom:** Gate 47's oppression becoming identification with suffering rather than realization through it
- **Performed grace:** Gate 22's emotional openness becoming manipulation, using social skill to extract rather than inspire
- **Chronic silence:** Gate 12's caution becoming avoidance, never risking the vulnerability of informed advocacy
- **Abstract detachment:** Gate 11's ideas becoming disconnected from lived reality, informing without grounding
- **Advocacy as ego:** The artful informer seeking recognition for their awareness rather than serving the oppressed

---

## Highest Expression

- **Transmuted understanding:** Gate 47's contemplation completing into wisdom that genuinely serves collective awareness
- **Authentic grace:** Gate 22's emotional presence creating safe space for difficult truths to land
- **Artful timing:** Gate 12's caution ensuring that advocacy serves those informed, not the informer's urgency
- **Grounded inspiration:** Gate 11's ideas connected to lived experience, inspiring action rather than mere agreement
- **Advocacy as service:** Using social skills and realization to genuinely redirect attention toward what matters
