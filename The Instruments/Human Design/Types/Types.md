# The Four Types
*Energy Configurations of Human Design*

---

## Overview

**Type** is the most fundamental distinction in Human Design—the broadest category determining how you are designed to engage with life.[^1] Your Type is determined by the configuration of defined Centers in your [[The BodyGraph|BodyGraph]], specifically the presence or absence of the [[Sacral]] Center and motor-to-[[Throat]] connections.[^2]

Type reveals not who you are but **how you operate**—your energetic mechanics, your correct way of engaging with opportunities, and the signature feeling that confirms you are living correctly.

## The Four Types

| Type | Population | Aura | Strategy | Signature | Not-Self |
|------|------------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| [[Manifestor]] | ~9% | Closed, repelling | Inform | Peace | Anger |
| [[Generator]] | ~37% | Open, enveloping | Wait to Respond | Satisfaction | Frustration |
| Manifesting Generator | ~33% | Open, enveloping | Wait to Respond, then Inform | Satisfaction | Frustration/Anger |
| [[Projector]] | ~20% | Focused, absorbing | Wait for Invitation | Success | Bitterness |
| [[Reflector]] | ~1% | Resistant, sampling | Wait a Lunar Cycle | Surprise | Disappointment |[^3]

*Note: Manifesting Generators are a sub-type of Generator with Manifestor characteristics.*

## Type Descriptions

### Manifestor
*The Initiator*

Manifestors are designed to **initiate action** independently. They have a closed aura that can feel repelling to others—not rejecting, but self-contained. Manifestors do not need permission or response; they are here to **start things**.

**Key Mechanics:**
- Motor connected to Throat (without Sacral definition)
- Aura is closed and impactful
- Strategy: **Inform** before acting to reduce resistance

**Signature:** When living correctly, Manifestors feel **peace**—the absence of resistance.
**Not-Self:** When not living correctly, Manifestors feel **anger**—the result of constant interference.

### Generator
*The Builder*

Generators are the **life force** of humanity—designed to work, build, create, and sustain. They have an open, enveloping aura that draws life to them. Generators are not initiators; they are **responders**.

**Key Mechanics:**
- Defined Sacral Center
- Aura is open and magnetic
- Strategy: **Wait to Respond** to something external

**Signature:** When living correctly, Generators feel **satisfaction**—deep fulfillment from correct work.
**Not-Self:** When not living correctly, Generators feel **frustration**—the result of initiating or doing wrong work.

### Manifesting Generator
*The Express Builder*

Manifesting Generators are a hybrid—Generators with Manifestor characteristics. They have the Sacral's sustainable energy but also a motor-to-Throat connection that gives them initiating capacity once the Sacral responds.

**Key Mechanics:**
- Defined Sacral plus motor-to-Throat
- Multi-passionate, non-linear, efficient
- Strategy: **Wait to Respond**, then **Inform** before acting

**Signature:** **Satisfaction** (like Generators)
**Not-Self:** **Frustration** (from not responding) and **Anger** (from not informing)

### Projector
*The Guide*

Projectors are designed to **guide and manage the energy of others**. They have a focused, penetrating aura that can see deeply into others' mechanics. Projectors are not here to work like Generators; they are here to be **recognized and invited**.

**Key Mechanics:**
- No Sacral definition, no motor-to-Throat
- Aura is focused and absorbing
- Strategy: **Wait for Invitation** for major life decisions

**Signature:** When living correctly, Projectors feel **success**—recognition and impact.
**Not-Self:** When not living correctly, Projectors feel **bitterness**—the result of unrecognized guidance.

### Reflector
*The Mirror*

Reflectors are the rarest Type—completely open, with no defined Centers. They are designed to **sample and reflect** the health of their environment. Reflectors are not here to be consistent; they are here to be **wise observers**.

**Key Mechanics:**
- No defined Centers (all nine Centers open)
- Aura is resistant and sampling
- Strategy: **Wait a Full Lunar Cycle** (28 days) for major decisions

**Signature:** When living correctly, Reflectors feel **surprise**—delighted by life's unfolding.
**Not-Self:** When not living correctly, Reflectors feel **disappointment**—the result of incorrect environments.

## Strategy by Type

| Type | Strategy | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Manifestor | Inform | Reduces resistance; others feel respected |
| Generator | Wait to Respond | Engages Sacral correctly; ensures life force alignment |
| Manifesting Generator | Respond, then Inform | Combines Generator response with Manifestor impact |
| Projector | Wait for Invitation | Ensures recognition; guidance lands |
| Reflector | Wait a Lunar Cycle | Allows sampling of all 64 gates; reveals clarity |
