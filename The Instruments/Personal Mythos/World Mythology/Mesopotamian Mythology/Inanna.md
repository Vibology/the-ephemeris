# Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth — Goddess of Love and War

## Overview

**Inanna** (Sumerian) or **Ishtar** (Akkadian/Babylonian) is the Mesopotamian goddess who embodies the **most radical integration of opposites** found in any world mythology—she is simultaneously the goddess of erotic love and violent war, fertility and destruction, political sovereignty and sacred sexuality, the radiant Queen of Heaven and the corpse hung on a meat-hook in the underworld. She is **the paradox made divine**.

Inanna is the **"Queen of Heaven and Earth,"** the planet **Venus** (both morning star and evening star), and the holder of the *Me* (divine decrees that govern civilization). Her primary symbol is the **eight-pointed star**, representing her astral nature and the eight-year cycle of Venus's synodic return. She is the most widely worshipped goddess of the ancient Near East, her cult spanning over 4,000 years from Sumerian Uruk (c. 3500 BCE) through Babylonian and Assyrian empires.

Unlike Greco-Roman goddesses where love (Aphrodite/Venus) and war (Athena/Minerva) are split between separate deities, **Inanna holds both**. She is desire AND aggression, beauty AND power, the lover AND the warrior. She refuses the patriarchal split between "good feminine" (nurturing, passive, receptive) and "bad feminine" (destructive, active, autonomous). As the *Hymn to Inanna* proclaims:

> "When I stand in the front, I am a leader.
> When I stand at the rear, I am a support.
> I am a woman whose words are well pleasing.
> I am Inanna!"

Her central myth—**The Descent of Inanna to the Underworld**—is one of the oldest recorded narratives in human history (c. 2000 BCE, preserved on cuneiform tablets) and remains **the archetypal template for the initiatory death-rebirth journey**. It encodes the necessary descent into shadow, the stripping of persona, the confrontation with the rejected self, and the resurrection that transforms rather than merely restores.

In Jungian terms, Inanna represents:
- **The integrated anima**—neither idealized nor demonized, but fierce, sexual, political, and sovereign
- **The ego's descent into the unconscious**—voluntary confrontation with the shadow
- **The union of Inanna and Ereshkigal**—the light and dark sisters who are one goddess split by repression

As the planet Venus, she is both **morning star** (virgin warrior, autonomous, rising before the sun) and **evening star** (seductress, harlot, appearing after sunset). She governs the full spectrum of love: from tender romance to brutal conquest, from sacred marriage to violent abandonment.

## The Sacred Narratives

### The Descent of Inanna to the Underworld

This is Inanna's central myth, preserved in Sumerian cuneiform tablets and translated by Samuel Noah Kramer and Diane Wolkstein.[^1] It is the **archetypal katabasis** (descent to the underworld)—the template for every initiatory journey into darkness.

**The Opening:**
Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth, "opens her ear to the Great Below." She abandons her seven temples in the seven cities of Sumer and prepares to descend to the underworld—the realm of her older sister **Ereshkigal**, the "Lady of the Great Place Below," Queen of the Dead.

The stated reason: she goes to attend the funeral rites of Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven (Ereshkigal's husband, whom Inanna herself caused to be slain after the Gilgamesh incident). But the deeper truth is unstated—**Inanna descends because she must**. Something incomplete in the radiant Queen demands the confrontation with what she has exiled to darkness.

Before she leaves, Inanna instructs her loyal minister **Ninshubur** (a gender-ambiguous figure, sometimes female, sometimes male): "If I do not return after three days, go to the gods and beg them to rescue me."

**The Seven Gates:**
Inanna arrives at the outer gate of the underworld and demands entry. The gatekeeper **Neti** reports to Ereshkigal, who is enraged: "What does the Queen of Heaven want in my realm?" But she does not refuse her sister. Instead, she instructs Neti:

> "Bolt the seven gates of the underworld.
> Then let Inanna enter.
> As she enters each gate, remove one of her royal garments.
> Let the holy priestess of heaven enter bowed low."

At each of the seven gates, Inanna is stopped. She protests: "What is this?" Neti replies each time: "Quiet, Inanna. The ways of the underworld are perfect. They may not be questioned."

The garments removed, gate by gate:
1. **The *shugurra* (crown)** — sovereignty, authority, the queenly self
2. **The measuring rod and lapis lazuli necklace** — rulership, the power to decree law
3. **The small lapis lazuli beads** — adornment, identity, the decorated persona
4. **The breastplate ("Come, man, come")** — sexuality, seduction, erotic power
5. **The gold ring** — commitment, marriage, binding
6. **The lapis lazuli measuring rod and line** — cosmic order, the ability to measure and define reality
7. **The royal robe** — the final covering, the last shred of identity

She arrives **naked and bowed low** before her sister.

**Death:**
Ereshkigal and the seven judges of the underworld (the Anunnaki) surround Inanna. Ereshkigal **fastens the Eye of Death upon her**—a look that kills. Inanna's corpse is hung on a **meat-hook** (or stake) and left to rot.

For three days and three nights, Inanna is dead.

**Resurrection:**
Ninshubur, faithful to her vow, goes to the gods begging for help. Enlil (sky god) and Nanna (moon god, Inanna's father) refuse: "She got what she deserved. She wanted the underworld; she can stay there."

But **Enki**, the god of wisdom and water, agrees to help. From the dirt under his fingernails, he creates two creatures—the **kurgarra** and **galatur** (sexless mourners, neither male nor female, liminal beings). He gives them the food and water of life and instructs them:

> "Ereshkigal will be moaning like a woman in labor.
> Mirror her moans. Groan with her.
> When she says, 'Oh, my inside!' say, 'Oh, your inside!'
> When she says, 'Oh, my outside!' say, 'Oh, your outside!'
> She will be grateful. She will offer you a gift.
> Ask for nothing but the corpse on the hook."

The mourners descend. They find Ereshkigal writhing, moaning, in agony—**no one has ever acknowledged her pain**. When they mirror her suffering without judgment or advice, she is moved. She offers them a gift. They ask for Inanna's corpse. Reluctantly, she agrees.

They sprinkle Inanna's body with the food and water of life. **Inanna rises.**

But the law of the underworld is absolute: **no one ascends from the Great Below without providing a substitute**. Demons (galla) seize Inanna and follow her back to the upper world, demanding a replacement.

Inanna encounters Ninshubur—but the faithful minister is dressed in rags, mourning. "Not this one." She finds her sons, also mourning. "Not these." But when she returns to her city Uruk, she finds her husband **Dumuzi** (the shepherd-god) sitting on her throne, dressed in magnificent robes, feasting—**he did not mourn her death**.

Inanna, enraged, **fastens the Eye of Death upon him**—the same look Ereshkigal used on her. The demons seize Dumuzi and drag him screaming to the underworld. His sister Geshtinanna offers to take his place for half the year, establishing the **seasonal cycle**—Dumuzi descends for autumn/winter, returns for spring/summer.

**Archetypal Meaning:**
This myth encodes **the most complete template for shadow integration** in world mythology:

1. **The Descent is Voluntary** — Inanna chooses to go. The ego must willingly turn toward the unconscious.
2. **The Stripping of Persona** — Each gate removes an aspect of identity: power, sexuality, adornment, sovereignty. To meet the shadow, the persona must be dissolved.
3. **The Shadow Sister** — Ereshkigal is Inanna's dark twin, the rejected, raging, suffering feminine exiled to the underworld. She is what Inanna refuses to be: powerless, invisible, alone, in pain.
4. **Death is Necessary** — Inanna is not just humbled; she is killed. Transformation requires the death of the old self.
5. **Empathy, Not Conquest** — Enki's mourners do not fight Ereshkigal, judge her, or try to fix her. They **witness and mirror her pain**. Only then does she release Inanna. The shadow cannot be conquered—only integrated through compassion.
6. **The Substitute Sacrifice** — Inanna cannot return to her old life unchanged. Something must be left behind (Dumuzi). Transformation has a cost.

Jung would see this as the **individuation process**: the ego (Inanna) descends to meet the shadow (Ereshkigal), dies to the old dominant, and rises transformed—but cannot reclaim the naive life. The marriage to Dumuzi (the old animus/consort) cannot be restored; it is sacrificed to enable new consciousness.

Sylvia Brinton Perera, in *Descent to the Goddess: A Way of Initiation for Women* (1981), interprets the myth as essential for women's psychological development:

> "Inanna's descent is the journey to reclaim the dark, rejected, 'unacceptable' feminine—the raw, instinctual, powerful, autonomous self that patriarchal culture exiles. Ereshkigal is the rage, the hunger, the sexuality, the death-power that 'good girls' are taught to repress. Only by descending, meeting her, and integrating her can the full feminine be restored."

### The Sacred Marriage (Hieros Gamos)

Inanna's union with **Dumuzi** (Sumerian shepherd-god, Akkadian **Tammuz**) is the **hieros gamos** (sacred marriage) enacted ritually in ancient Mesopotamia. The Sumerian king would embody Dumuzi, the high priestess would embody Inanna, and their sexual union was performed publicly to ensure:
- Fertility of the land
- Abundance of crops and livestock
- Legitimacy of the king's reign
- Cosmic order and divine favor

The *Sacred Marriage Hymns* are some of the most erotic poetry in ancient literature. Inanna sings:

> "My vulva, the horn,
> The Boat of Heaven,
> Is full of eagerness like the young moon.
> My untilled land lies fallow.
> As for me, Inanna,
> Who will plow my vulva?
> Who will plow my high field?
> Who will plow my wet ground?"

Dumuzi replies:

> "Great Lady, the king will plow your vulva.
> I, Dumuzi the King, will plow your vulva."

This is **sexuality as sacred act**—the body as temple, pleasure as worship, desire as divine force. Inanna's temples may have practiced forms of ritual sexuality (debated by scholars), but at minimum, the sacred marriage rite encoded the principle that **the erotic is holy**.

Yet the marriage has a shadow: after Inanna's descent, she chooses Dumuzi as her substitute sacrifice. He who was her beloved becomes the one she condemns to death. The sacred marriage is broken by the underworld journey—**the descent transforms love into judgment**.

**Archetypal Meaning:**
The sacred marriage represents the **coniunctio** (union of opposites): king and goddess, earth and heaven, masculine and feminine. But it also reveals that **innocence cannot survive transformation**. The naive beloved (Dumuzi) who does not mourn, who does not honor the descent, cannot remain. The post-descent Inanna demands a partner who has also met shadow. The old animus (Dumuzi as shepherd-boy lover) must die for a new relational pattern to emerge.

---

### The Conquest of the Me (Divine Decrees)

In another myth, the young Inanna visits **Enki**, god of wisdom, in his city Eridu. Enki, pleased by her beauty, gets drunk on beer and impulsively **gives her the *Me***—the divine decrees that govern all aspects of civilization:
- Kingship, priesthood, truth, descent to the underworld
- Sexual intercourse, kissing, prostitution
- The art of lovemaking, law, music, metalwork
- The destruction of cities, victory, lamentation

Inanna loads the *Me* into her Boat of Heaven and sails away. When Enki sobers, he realizes what he's done and sends demons to retrieve them. But Inanna outmaneuvers every attempt and successfully brings the *Me* to her city **Uruk**, establishing it as the center of culture and power.

**Archetypal Meaning:**
This myth encodes the **Promethean theft**—the younger generation (Inanna) stealing power/knowledge from the older gods (Enki). It also reveals Inanna's **political ambition and cunning**—she is not merely a love goddess but a sovereign who claims rulership through strategy, not just divine right.

The *Me* include both "high" culture (law, kingship) and "low" culture (sexuality, prostitution, lamentation)—Inanna integrates the full spectrum, refusing to separate the sacred and profane.

### The Conflict with Gilgamesh

In the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, **Ishtar** (Inanna's Akkadian form) proposes marriage to the hero **Gilgamesh** after he slays the monster Humbaba. She is drawn to his strength and beauty. But Gilgamesh rejects her with a brutal litany of her past lovers:

> "Which lover did you love forever?
> Which shepherd pleased you for all time?
> You loved the lion, perfect in strength—
> Then you dug seven and seven pits for him.
> You loved the stallion, proud in battle—
> You ordained for him the whip, the goad, the lash.
> You loved Dumuzi, the shepherd of your youth—
> Yet you decreed for him a bitter fate year after year."

Ishtar, enraged by the insult, goes to her father **Anu** (sky god) and demands the **Bull of Heaven** to destroy Uruk. Anu releases it, and the Bull kills hundreds. But Gilgamesh and **Enkidu** slay the Bull. Enkidu hurls the Bull's thigh at Ishtar's face, mocking her.

In revenge, Ishtar causes Enkidu's death (via divine decree), setting in motion Gilgamesh's quest for immortality and ultimate confrontation with mortality.

**Archetypal Meaning:**
This myth reveals Inanna/Ishtar's **shadow as the destructive lover**—the goddess who consumes her consorts. Gilgamesh's accusation is archetypal: the Great Goddess brings death to those she loves (Dumuzi, Tammuz, Adonis, Attis). This is the **devouring anima**, the feminine that the hero must reject to maintain autonomy.

Yet the myth also shows **patriarchal fear of sovereign feminine sexuality**—Gilgamesh refuses Ishtar because he cannot tolerate a woman with power, sexual history, and the right to choose. His rejection is the hero's need to subordinate the feminine.

The Bull of Heaven is Ishtar's rage unleashed—the destructive force of the rejected feminine. When the anima is spurned, she withdraws her blessing (Enkidu's death). The hero loses his companion, his vitality, his innocence.

## Jungian Analysis

### The Shadow Sister: Inanna and Ereshkigal as One

The central psychological truth of the Inanna myth is that **Inanna and Ereshkigal are not separate beings but two aspects of a single goddess split by repression**. Ereshkigal is the shadow—the rejected, exiled, suffering aspect of the feminine that patriarchal (and matriarchal) culture cannot tolerate.

**Inanna (Light Anima):**
- Radiant, visible, celebrated
- Queen, priestess, warrior, lover
- Active, autonomous, commanding
- Holds power in the upper world (heaven and earth)
- Associated with Venus as Morning Star (visible, bright)

**Ereshkigal (Shadow Anima):**
- Dark, invisible, abandoned
- Queen of the Dead, the forgotten
- Suffering, raging, writhing in pain
- Holds power in the underworld (the Great Below)
- Associated with the dark moon, the womb-tomb

Jung writes:

> "The shadow is the inferior part of the personality; sum total of all personal and collective psychic elements which, because of their incompatibility with the chosen conscious attitude, are denied expression in life." (CW 9i, par. 422)

Ereshkigal is Inanna's shadow—**the pain, rage, hunger, sexuality, death-power that the "good girl" goddess must repress to be acceptable**. She is the feminine exiled for being:
- Too hungry (greedy, devouring)
- Too angry (raging, violent)
- Too sexual (raw, uncontrolled)
- Too powerful (terrifying, death-dealing)

Perera writes:

> "Ereshkigal is the woman who has been told she is too much: too loud, too angry, too sexual, too ambitious. She is the part of the feminine psyche that patriarchy (and internalized misogyny) has locked in the basement and labeled 'unacceptable.' She rages in isolation because **no one witnesses her suffering**."

The descent is the **voluntary confrontation with this split**. Inanna does not go to conquer Ereshkigal but to **meet her**. The stripping of garments is the removal of persona—the socially acceptable masks—until only the raw, naked self remains.

When Enki's mourners simply **witness Ereshkigal's pain without judgment**, she is transformed. This is the key: **the shadow does not need to be fixed or destroyed—it needs to be acknowledged, mourned, and integrated**.

After the descent, Inanna returns transformed—she is no longer the innocent, radiant Queen but a goddess who has integrated death, rage, and the power to condemn (Dumuzi). She is **Inanna-Ereshkigal**, the whole goddess.

### The Venus-Pluto Archetype

In archetypal astrology, the Inanna myth encodes the **Venus-Pluto** dynamic—the transformation of love through the experience of death, powerlessness, and underworld descent. Richard Tarnas writes of Venus-Pluto:

> "Compulsive, intense, transformative desires... the fusion of love and death, Eros and Thanatos... relationships as initiatory crucibles." (*Cosmos and Psyche*, p. 398)

Inanna (Venus) descends to Ereshkigal's realm (Pluto/Hades)—love must pass through death to be reborn. The naive, surface love (Dumuzi as romantic consort) cannot survive the underworld. Only a love that has integrated shadow, rage, and mortality can endure.

This is the difference between:
- **Aphrodite** (Venus alone)—beauty, pleasure, romantic love, surface connection
- **Inanna** (Venus-Pluto integrated)—beauty forged in the underworld, love that includes rage and death, erotic power fused with destruction

Modern astrologers track the **Venus retrograde cycle** (every 18-19 months) as an Inanna-descent—a time when love, values, and beauty undergo underworld initiation.

### The Integrated Anima

For men, Inanna represents the **integrated anima**—the feminine soul-image that is neither idealized (pure maiden) nor demonized (devouring witch) but **fully autonomous, sexual, political, and sovereign**.

Jung's stages of anima development culminate in **Sophia** (Wisdom)—but Inanna is Sophia who has also been whore, warrior, queen, and corpse. She is the anima who:
- Demands to be met as an equal (not worshipped or dominated)
- Contains both nurturing and destruction
- Will not be reduced to a role (mother, muse, maiden)
- Chooses her lovers and discards them when they fail her

Gilgamesh's rejection of Ishtar is the **hero's flight from the integrated anima**—he cannot tolerate a woman with power and sexual autonomy. His punishment (loss of Enkidu, confrontation with mortality) is the cost of refusing relationship with the full feminine.

### The Substitute Sacrifice and the Cost of Transformation

The myth's most troubling element—Inanna condemning Dumuzi to the underworld—encodes a psychological truth: **individuation requires sacrifice**. The old relational pattern (Dumuzi) cannot survive the transformation. Inanna cannot return from the underworld and resume her naive marriage to the shepherd-boy.

Jung writes:

> "Individuation cuts one off from personal conformity and hence from collectivity... It is a bitter truth that the individuating ego must sacrifice treasured relationships." (CW 7, par. 267)

Dumuzi's failure is that **he did not mourn**. He did not honor Inanna's descent, did not hold space for her transformation. When she returns, he is on her throne—he has usurped her power rather than guarding it. **The partner who cannot witness the descent cannot remain.**

This is the shadow of the descent: it destroys innocence. Post-descent Inanna has the Eye of Death—she can condemn. She is no longer the lover who gives unconditionally but the sovereign who judges.

---

## Shadow Dynamics

### The Devouring Lover

Inanna/Ishtar's shadow is the **goddess who destroys her lovers**—Gilgamesh's litany names them: the lion trapped in pits, the stallion whipped, Dumuzi condemned to die. This is the **devouring anima**, the feminine that consumes rather than nourishes.

Psychologically, this appears as:
- The woman whose relationships always end in destruction (projection of Inanna's pattern)
- The anima possession in men—the inner feminine that devours vitality
- The love that demands total sacrifice (the lover as Dumuzi, offered to the underworld)

The integration: **own the destructive power**. Inanna does not apologize for her pattern—she is the goddess of love AND war. To love her is to risk being her substitute. The conscious choice: accept this or refuse relationship (Gilgamesh's choice).

### The Refusal to Descend

The shadow of the descent is the **refusal to go down**—the ego that clings to light, persona, the upper world. This is the woman (or man) who:
- Maintains the shiny persona but exiles the shadow to the basement (Ereshkigal raging alone)
- Refuses to meet suffering, loss, or death
- Lives on the surface, terrified of depth
- Becomes brittle, defended, afraid of her own darkness

Without the descent, Ereshkigal remains split off, raging, and the full feminine cannot be integrated. The result: depression, psychosomatic illness, sudden breakdowns—the shadow forces descent when it is refused.

### The Substitute (Scapegoat) Pattern

Inanna's condemnation of Dumuzi reveals the **scapegoat dynamic**—someone must pay for transformation. This shadow appears as:
- The partner/child/friend who becomes the "substitute" for unintegrated shadow
- Projection of rage/pain onto another (blaming rather than owning)
- The demand that others mourn when we do not mourn ourselves

Dumuzi's sister Geshtinanna volunteers to take his place for half the year—she **witnesses his suffering and shares it**. This is the integration: not demanding a substitute but **sharing the burden**.

### Integration Path

To integrate Inanna's shadow:

1. **Descend voluntarily.** Do not wait for life to force you into the underworld. Choose to turn toward shadow.
2. **Strip the persona.** Identify the seven garments—the identities, roles, defenses you wear. Let them go, gate by gate.
3. **Meet Ereshkigal with compassion.** When you find the raging, suffering shadow, do not fight it, fix it, or flee. Witness it. Mirror it. "Oh, your inside!" This is the mourners' work.
4. **Accept the cost.** Transformation requires sacrifice. Not everything survives the descent. Mourn what must be left behind (Dumuzi).
5. **Own the Eye of Death.** Post-descent, you will have power you did not have before—the power to condemn, to judge, to see through falsehood. Use it consciously.

---

## Practical Application

### Recognition in Life

**Inanna's archetype activates when:**
- You feel called to descend into darkness, loss, or confrontation with shadow
- You embody both love and war, refusing to split the fierce feminine
- You experience the death-rebirth cycle in relationships, vocation, or identity
- You encounter the substitute pattern (who must be sacrificed for your transformation?)
- You feel the pull of Venus (desire, beauty, connection) fused with Mars (aggression, autonomy, power)

**Symptoms of Inanna-complex (positive):**
- Integration of love and power, sexuality and sovereignty
- Willingness to descend voluntarily (not fleeing shadow)
- Fierce autonomy and refusal to be reduced to a role
- Capacity to love deeply and leave decisively
- Political/creative ambition fused with erotic vitality

**Symptoms of Inanna-complex (shadow):**
- Pattern of devouring lovers (relationships end in destruction)
- Refusal to descend (clinging to persona, terrified of shadow)
- Scapegoating others (demanding substitutes rather than bearing the cost)
- Venus-Pluto compulsion (love as death, desire as control)
- Splitting light/dark (Inanna exalted, Ereshkigal rejected)

### Working with Inanna

**Invocation (for the descent):**
When you are called to descend into shadow, grief, or transformation:

> *Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth,*
> *You who descended to the Great Below,*
> *You who were stripped naked at the seven gates,*
> *You who hung on the hook and died and rose,*
> *Walk with me into my underworld.*
> *I abandon my seven temples.*
> *I open my ear to the Great Below.*
> *Strip me of persona, of pride, of power.*
> *Let me meet my shadow sister face to face.*
> *Grant me Ninshubur's faithfulness,*
> *Enki's wisdom,*
> *And the mourners' compassionate witness.*
> *I descend. I die. I rise transformed.*

**Shadow Work Exercise: Inanna and Ereshkigal Mirror**

Identify your light and shadow sisters:

1. **Inanna (Your Light Self):**
   - What do you show the world? Your persona, accomplishments, acceptable traits?
   - What roles do you perform? (Queen, priestess, lover, warrior, mother, professional?)
   - What garments do you wear? (Titles, identities, defenses?)

2. **Ereshkigal (Your Shadow Self):**
   - What have you exiled to the basement? (Rage, hunger, sexuality, grief, ambition?)
   - What parts of yourself do you label "unacceptable"?
   - What is suffering in isolation, unwitnessed?

3. **The Descent:**
   - Visualize the seven gates. What must you strip at each? (Gate 1: Crown of achievement. Gate 2: Role as nurturer. Gate 3: Physical beauty. Gate 4: Sexuality/seduction. Gate 5: Relationship/marriage. Gate 6: Power/control. Gate 7: Final identity.)
   - Arrive naked before Ereshkigal. What does she say? What is her pain?

4. **The Mourners' Work:**
   - Do not try to fix her. Mirror her: "Oh, your inside! Oh, your outside!"
   - Write her pain in her own words (first person, raw, no editing).

5. **Integration:**
   - What gift does she offer? (The corpse = the old self that can now be resurrected transformed.)
   - Who is your Dumuzi? What must be sacrificed for you to return whole?

**Ritual of the Seven Gates:**

Create a physical descent ritual:

1. **Gather seven objects** representing your persona/identity (crown/hat, jewelry, belt, scarf, ring, etc.).
2. **Walk seven steps backward**, removing one item at each step. Speak aloud what you release:
   "At the first gate, I release my title as _____."
   "At the second gate, I release my role as _____."
   (Continue through all seven.)
3. **Sit or lie naked** (or in minimal clothing) in darkness for 15-30 minutes. This is the death. Breathe. Do not flee.
4. **After the time, slowly gather the items**, but put them on differently—in new order, or leave some behind. You are not restoring the old self but creating a new one.
5. **Speak your resurrection:**
   "I am Inanna-Ereshkigal. Light and shadow, one goddess."

**For the Devouring Lover Pattern:**

If you recognize Inanna's pattern of consuming partners:

1. **Name the pattern honestly.** "I have a history of relationships that end in destruction."
2. **Ask: Who was Dumuzi?** The partner who did not witness your descent? Who sat on your throne while you suffered?
3. **Own the Eye of Death.** You condemned him. Not wrong, but powerful. Can you wield this consciously rather than compulsively?
4. **Find Geshtinanna energy.** Who in your life shares the burden rather than demanding a substitute?
