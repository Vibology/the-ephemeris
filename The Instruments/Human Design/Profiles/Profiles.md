# The 12 Profiles
*The Costume of Incarnation*

---

## Overview

**Profile** is the costume you wear in this life—the archetypal role you play in the drama of existence.[^1] Determined by the lines of your Personality Sun/Earth (conscious) and Design Sun/Earth (unconscious), Profile describes *how* you are designed to interact with the world and fulfill your purpose.

There are **12 Profiles** formed from combinations of the six lines:

| Line | Name | Theme |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Investigator | Foundation, research, security through knowledge |
| 2 | Hermit | Natural talent, projection, called out by others |
| 3 | Martyr | Trial and error, experimentation, bonds made and broken |
| 4 | Opportunist | Networks, influence, fixed foundations |
| 5 | Heretic | Universalization, projection field, practical solutions |
| 6 | Role Model | Three-part life, objectivity, living example |

## The 12 Profile Combinations

### Right Angle Profiles (Personal Destiny)
Focused on personal karma—your journey is primarily about your own development.

| Profile | Name | Theme |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[1-3 Investigator Martyr]] | Investigator/Martyr | Research through trial and error |
| [[1-4 Investigator Opportunist]] | Investigator/Opportunist | Deep knowledge shared through networks |
| [[2-4 Hermit Opportunist]] | Hermit/Opportunist | Natural gifts expressed through relationships |
| [[2-5 Hermit Heretic]] | Hermit/Heretic | Called to universalize natural talents |
| [[3-5 Martyr Heretic]] | Martyr/Heretic | Experiential wisdom offered as solutions |
| [[3-6 Martyr Role Model]] | Martyr/Role Model | Learning through mistakes, becoming example |
| [[4-6 Opportunist Role Model]] | Opportunist/Role Model | Influencing networks, modeling truth |

### Juxtaposition Profile (Fixed Fate)
Geometry locked—neither personal nor transpersonal, simply fixed trajectory.

| Profile | Name | Theme |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[4-1 Opportunist Investigator]] | Opportunist/Investigator | Fixed network, authoritative foundation |

### Left Angle Profiles (Transpersonal Karma)
Your journey is intertwined with others—fulfillment comes through impact on the collective.

| Profile | Name | Theme |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[5-1 Heretic Investigator]] | Heretic/Investigator | Practical solutions based on solid research |
| [[5-2 Heretic Hermit]] | Heretic/Hermit | Projected upon, called to share natural gifts |
| [[6-2 Role Model Hermit]] | Role Model/Hermit | Living example of natural talent |
| [[6-3 Role Model Martyr]] | Role Model/Martyr | Wisdom earned through life's experiments |

## The Three-Part Life of Line 6

All profiles containing Line 6 experience life in three distinct phases:

**Phase 1 (Birth to ~30):** Living as a 3rd line—trial and error, experimentation, bumping into life
**Phase 2 (~30 to ~50):** "On the roof"—observing, healing, gaining objectivity
**Phase 3 (~50 onward):** Descending as the Role Model—living example of earned wisdom

## Profile and Purpose

Your Profile works with your [[Incarnation Crosses]] to define your purpose:
- **Incarnation Cross:** The *what* of your purpose (the theme)
- **Profile:** The *how* of your purpose (the costume, the style)

A 1/3 and a 5/1 with the same Incarnation Cross will fulfill similar themes through completely different approaches.
