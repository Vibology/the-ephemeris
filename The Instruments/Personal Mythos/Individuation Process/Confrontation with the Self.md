# Confrontation with the Self: The Rubedo of Union

**Individuation Stage 5 | Midlife–Elder 50–70 | Alchemical Operation: Rubedo**

## Overview

### Jung's Definition: The Supraordinate Personality

In *Two Essays on Analytical Psychology* (CW 7), *Aion* (CW 9ii), and *Psychology and Alchemy* (CW 12), Jung defines the Self as **the totality of the psyche**—a reality **supraordinate to the conscious ego**:

> "The self is a quantity that is supraordinate to the conscious ego.[^1] It embraces not only the conscious but also the unconscious psyche... the self is our life's goal, for it is the completest expression of that fateful combination we call individuality." (*Two Essays*, CW 7, ¶405)

> "The self is not only the centre but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of this totality, just as the ego is the centre of consciousness." (*Psychology and Alchemy*, CW 12, ¶44)

**The Critical Shift:** In the first half of life (Stages 1-2), the **ego believes it is the master**. In the second half (Stages 3-6), the ego must discover that it is the **servant** of a greater reality—the Self.

The Self is:
- **The God-image in the psyche:** Empirically indistinguishable from the image of deity
- **The totality:** Including light and dark, conscious and unconscious, good and evil
- **The goal of individuation:** The telos toward which the whole process moves
- **The archetype of order:** Manifesting as mandalas, quaternity, wholeness symbols

### The Ego-Self Axis

Jung's mature psychology centers on the **Ego-Self Axis**—the relationship between the ego (center of consciousness) and the Self (center of totality):

> "The ego is to the self as the moved to the mover, or as object to subject." (*Aion*, CW 9ii, ¶9)

The task of this stage is to **relativize the ego**—to shift the center of gravity from ego to Self. This does not mean the ego is destroyed (that would be psychosis) but that it **surrenders its claim to autonomy** and recognizes itself as a **function of the Self**.

This is the **reversal of childhood**: In Stage 1 (Ego Formation), the ego emerges *from* the Self. In Stage 5 (Self Confrontation), the ego returns *to* the Self—but now consciously.

### The Mandala: Symbol of the Self

Jung observed that when patients approached the Self, they spontaneously drew or dreamed **mandalas**—circular, symmetrical images representing wholeness:

> "The mandala is the center. It is the exponent of all paths. It is the path to the center, to individuation." (*Collected Works*)

The mandala appears across cultures:
- **Hindu/Buddhist:** Yantra, thangka paintings, temple architecture
- **Christian:** Rose windows, halos, the cross in a circle
- **Alchemical:** The *squaring of the circle*, the *Philosopher's Stone*
- **Psychological:** Spontaneous drawings of circles, quaternities, mandalas in therapy

The mandala is the **Imago Dei** (image of God), the **Self** projected into symbolic form.

## Practical Application

### Recognition in Life

This stage is observable through:

**Shift in Values:**
- Meaning becomes more important than achievement
- Service replaces ambition
- Being replaces doing
- Wisdom replaces knowledge
- "What is the purpose of my life?" replaces "How do I succeed?"

**Synchronicity Increases:**
- Meaningful coincidences become frequent, undeniable
- The sense that "something is guiding my life"
- Experiences of the *numinous* (the holy, the sacred, the uncanny)
- Dreams of wholeness symbols (mandalas, circles, quaternity)

**Ego Relativization:**
- Recognizing "I am not the author of my life; I am living a life that is also living me"
- Humility: "I am small before the vastness of the unconscious"
- Surrender: "Thy will be done" (not my ego's will but the Self's will)

**Crisis of Meaning:**
- If the ego resists relativization: existential despair, "What's the point of anything?"
- If the ego surrenders: profound sense of purpose, even in suffering

### Successful Integration

A well-integrated Ego-Self relationship demonstrates:
- **Meaning:** Life has purpose and direction, even when circumstances are difficult
- **Wholeness:** The individual can hold paradox—light and dark, good and evil, strength and weakness
- **Teleology:** A sense of destiny—"My life is going somewhere, even if I don't fully understand where"
- **Service:** The ego serves the Self's aims rather than personal inflation
- **Humility:** Recognizing oneself as part of a greater whole, not the center of the universe

## Jungian Analysis

### 1. Jung's Theory Deep Dive: The Self as God-Image

Jung's most controversial claim: **The Self is empirically indistinguishable from the image of God in the psyche.**

> "Strictly speaking, the God-image does not coincide with the unconscious as such, but with a special content of it, namely the archetype of the self. It is this archetype from which we can no longer distinguish the God-image empirically." (*Psychology and Alchemy*, CW 12, ¶14)

**What Jung meant:**
- He is NOT claiming "God is just the Self" (reductionism)
- He is NOT claiming "the Self is literally God" (inflation)
- He IS claiming: **The psyche experiences the Self as divine**—it has the qualities traditionally attributed to deity (numinous, overwhelming, totalizing, source of meaning and order)

**The Self's Divine Qualities:**
- **Totalizing:** It encompasses everything—conscious and unconscious, good and evil
- **Numinous:** Encounters with the Self provoke awe, terror, wonder (Rudolf Otto's *mysterium tremendum*)
- **Teleological:** It has purpose, direction, intentionality
- **Archetypal Order:** It manifests as mandalas, quaternity, wholeness symbols (like descriptions of the divine)

**The Risk:** Confusing the ego with the Self. Believing "I am God" rather than "The Self is the God-image, and I serve it."

### 2. Cross-Cultural Manifestations: The Realized Self

**Christ Consciousness (Christian):** "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30). Christ as the **Anthropos**—the Completed Human who unites mortal and divine. The Son of Man within, the realization of the God-image in human form.

**Atman-Brahman (Hindu):** The formula *Tat Tvam Asi* ("That Art Thou")—the realization that the individual soul (Atman) is identical with the Universal Reality (Brahman). Not "I am God" but "The Self within me IS the divine reality."

**Buddha Nature (Buddhist):** The realization that all beings possess the Buddha-nature—enlightenment is not becoming something new but **recognizing what already is**. The Self is primordially present, obscured by ignorance.

**The Philosopher's Stone (Alchemy):** The *Lapis Philosophorum* is the goal of the Great Work—the substance that transforms base metal into gold. Psychologically, this is the **Self**—the reality that transforms the lead of the ego into the gold of wholeness.

**The Hierosgamos (Sacred Marriage):** The union of King and Queen, Sun and Moon, spirit and soul. This produces the **Divine Child**—the new consciousness, the realized Self.

### 3. Fairy Tale Analysis: The Hidden Treasure

**"The Spirit in the Bottle" (Grimm):** A young man releases a spirit from a bottle who threatens to kill him. Through cleverness, he tricks the spirit back into the bottle and is rewarded with a magic cloth that heals and transforms. This is the **Self**—initially threatening (numinous, overwhelming) but when related to correctly (ego as clever servant, not master), it provides healing and transformation.

**"The Water of Life" (Grimm):** The youngest son must retrieve the Water of Life to heal his dying father (the old king). He encounters an old man (Wise Old Man = Self projection) who guides him. The Water is the **elixir of the Self**—that which restores life and meaning.

**"The Golden Bird" (Grimm):** The hero must retrieve the Golden Bird (the Self's treasure). Each attempt to possess it through force or cleverness fails. Only when he follows the fox's (instinct's) guidance without question does he succeed. The ego must **surrender control** to the Self's direction.

### 4. Developmental Psychology: Ego-Transcendence

**Erik Erikson - Ego Integrity vs. Despair (65+):** The final crisis—can the individual accept their life as it was, or do they fall into regret and despair? Ego Integrity requires **surrendering the ego's demand** that life should have been different and accepting "This is the life I lived, and it has meaning."

**Maslow's Self-Actualization:** The peak of the hierarchy of needs—not just survival or belonging but **becoming what one is meant to be**. Maslow later added **self-transcendence**—moving beyond self-actualization to serve something greater. This is the Ego-Self Axis—the ego serves the Self's transcendent purpose.

**Kohlberg's Stage 6 (Universal Ethical Principles):** The highest stage of moral development—acting according to universal principles (justice, compassion, truth) rather than personal gain or social approval. This requires the ego to submit to a **higher law** (the Self's ethical imperative).

### 5. Hero's Journey Integration: The Resurrection and Return

In Campbell's monomyth, **Confrontation with the Self** corresponds to:

**The Resurrection (Stage 11):** The second "death"—the final test where the hero must prove their transformation is real. They are "resurrected" as a **Master of Two Worlds** (conscious and unconscious, mundane and sacred, ego and Self).

**Return with the Elixir (Stage 12):** The hero brings the boon (the treasure, the wisdom, the healing) back to the community. This is **service**—the ego serves the Self's intention to heal and restore the collective.

Examples:
- **Christ:** Resurrection after crucifixion, then ascension—the Self triumphant over death
- **Buddha:** Enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, then spending 40 years teaching—the Self serving the world
- **Inanna:** Returning from the underworld transformed, with the wisdom of death—the Self integrated

### 6. Individuation Process: The Penultimate Stage

**Position:** Stage 5 of 6 in the Individuation Process
**Function:** The realization of wholeness (preparation for death in Stage 6)

**Why this stage comes after Shadow and Anima/Animus:**
- **Shadow integration** (Stage 3) ensures the ego can hold the Self's darkness without being destroyed
- **Anima/Animus integration** (Stage 4) provides the **bridge** to the collective unconscious where the Self resides
- Without these, encountering the Self leads to **inflation** (ego identifies with God) or **dissolution** (ego destroyed by the numinous)

**The Self Contains:**
- All that was integrated in previous stages: Shadow, Anima/Animus, Persona
- All opposites: Good and evil, masculine and feminine, conscious and unconscious
- The totality of the personality—past, present, and future (teleology)

Jung: "The self is the goal of individuation, and individuation is the goal of life."

### 7. Alchemical Correlation: Rubedo as Sacred Marriage

In alchemy, **Rubedo** (reddening) follows **Albedo** (whitening). It is the final stage—the **sacred marriage** (*Coniunctio*) of the Red King (Sun, spirit, masculine) and the White Queen (Moon, soul, feminine) to produce the **Philosopher's Stone** (*Lapis Philosophorum*).

**Symbolic images of Rubedo:**
- **The Red King and White Queen united in bed**—the *Hierosgamos*
- **The Phoenix rising from ashes**—death and resurrection
- **The Double-Headed Hermaphrodite** (*Rebis*)—the union of opposites in one body
- **The Lapis / The Stone**—the imperishable, unified, whole
- **The Sunrise / Aurora**—the dawn of new consciousness

**Psychological process:**
- **Nigredo** (Stage 3) = Shadow integration, death of ego-inflation
- **Albedo** (Stage 4) = Soul-work, purification, Anima/Animus
- **Rubedo** (Stage 5) = Union of all opposites in the Self

The **Coniunctio** is not just the union of masculine and feminine but of **all opposites**:
- Conscious and unconscious
- Light and dark
- Spirit and matter
- Ego and Self

Jung: "The self is the *coniunctio oppositorum*—the union of opposites—made manifest."

### 8. Shadow and Pathology: The Perils of Inflation

**Inflation:** The most dangerous risk of this stage. The ego **identifies with the Self** rather than recognizing it as **supraordinate**. This produces:

**Megalomania:** "I am God." "I am enlightened." "I am above moral law." The individual believes they possess the power of the archetype rather than **serving** it. Jung: "The ego... imagines that he does possess it [mana/power]; and on the other hand he is possessed by it."

**Guru Complex:** Believing oneself to be the Savior, the Messiah, the Chosen One. Demanding worship from followers. This is the ego **inflated** by the Self rather than **relativized** by it.

**Psychotic Break:** If the ego is too weak or the Self too powerful, the boundary between them dissolves. The individual **loses reality**—believing they *are* the archetype, not an individual relating to it. Schizophrenia, religious mania, paranoid delusions of grandeur.

**Hubris:** The "god-almighty" complex. Believing nothing is beyond one's power, understanding, or control. This is the ego **refusing** to serve the Self, clinging to autonomy. The result: *Enantiodromia*—a violent reversal, often a catastrophic fall.

**Spiritual Bypassing:** Using "spirituality" to avoid the Shadow. "I am one with all" (therefore I don't need to own my petty cruelties). "Everything is love" (therefore I can ignore injustice). This is **premature Self-identification** without doing the work of Stages 3-4.

### 9. Projection Dynamics: The Self Projected onto Gurus and Saviors

**Guru Projection:** The Self is projected onto spiritual teachers, gurus, cult leaders. The individual experiences them as **divine**, all-knowing, perfect. This is the Self **externalized** rather than **internalized**.

**Messiah Projection:** The Self is projected onto political leaders, revolutionaries, or movements. "This person / group will save us." When the projection fails (as it must), the result is disillusionment or rage.

**Withdrawal Process:**
1. Recognize the **numinous quality** of your reaction to the person/movement
2. Ask: "What aspect of the divine am I seeing in them?"
3. Locate the Self **within yourself**—you contain the God-image, not just the guru
4. Return to the teacher/leader as a **human being** who may have wisdom but is not the divine incarnate

**The Gift:** You can relate to teachers and guides without **needing** them to be God. You access your own **inner authority** (the Self).

### 10. Dream Symbolism: Mandalas and Wholeness Images

**Common Self Dream Motifs:**

**The Mandala:** Circles, quaternity (four elements, four directions), symmetrical patterns. These are spontaneous **Self-symbols**—the psyche representing its own wholeness.

**The Divine Child:** A miraculous infant, often threatened but protected. This is the **new consciousness** born from the union of opposites (Coniunctio).

**The Wise Old Man / Woman:** A figure of ultimate authority and wisdom. This is the Self projected as a guide or teacher.

**The Center:** Dreams of finding the center of a labyrinth, the heart of a castle, the core of a mountain. The Self as the **center of the psyche**.

**The Treasure / The Stone:** Gold, jewels, the Philosopher's Stone. The Self as the **imperishable** reality.

**The King and Queen United:** The sacred marriage, often in a temple or sacred space. The Coniunctio—the union of opposites producing the Self.

**Light / The Sun:** Overwhelming light, the rising sun, a blinding brilliance. The Self as **consciousness itself**, the *sol niger* (black sun) become radiant.

### 11. Relationship to Other Archetypes

**Shadow (Integrated):** The Self **includes** the Shadow. Wholeness is not "all light" but light *and* dark. Jung: "The self is good and evil, God and Satan, above and below."

**Anima/Animus (United):** The Self is the product of the sacred marriage—Anima and Animus united in the *Coniunctio*. The Self is the **Divine Child** born from their union.

**Persona (Relativized):** The Persona is recognized as a **mask**, not the totality. The Self encompasses the Persona but is not limited by it.

**Ego (Servant):** The relationship reverses. In childhood, the ego emerges from the Self. In elderhood, the ego **serves** the Self. Jung: "The ego is to the Self as the moved to the mover."

**God-Image (Indistinguishable):** The Self is experienced as divine—numinous, totalizing, the source of meaning and order. Jung was careful: this is **psychological fact**, not metaphysical claim.

### 12. The Gift of Integration: Meaning, Wholeness, and Destiny

**What Self-Realization Provides:**

**Meaning (Teleology):** Life has **purpose** even in suffering. The Self provides the sense that "my life is going somewhere." Viktor Frankl: "He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."

**Wholeness (Not Perfection):** The individual can hold **paradox**—light and dark, strength and weakness, good and evil—without splitting. Jung: "I am not what happened to me; I am what I choose to become." But also: "I am all of it—the shadow and the light."

**Humility:** Recognizing oneself as **part of a greater whole**. The ego is small; the Self is vast. This prevents inflation. Teresa of Ávila: "Humility is truth."

**Service:** The ego serves the Self's aims—which are often collective (healing, teaching, creating, serving). The individual becomes a **vessel** for something greater.

**Preparation for Death:** Encountering the Self prepares one for death. If the ego is the center, death is annihilation. If the Self is the center, death is **transition**—the ego dissolves, but the Self (the God-image, the eternal) remains.

**The Unus Mundus:** The perception of the "One World" where spirit and matter, inner and outer, are continuous. Synchronicity becomes **normal**—the universe is alive, intelligent, responsive.

**Freedom:** Paradoxically, surrendering to the Self brings **freedom**. The ego's tyranny (anxious control, endless striving) is released. The individual can **be** rather than constantly **becoming**.

#### The Gift
A **whole human being** who has shifted the center of gravity from ego to Self, who experiences life as **meaningful** even in suffering, who serves something greater than personal ambition, who is prepared for death because the Self—the eternal reality within—has been realized.
