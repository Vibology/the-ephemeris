# Strategy

---


*The Geometry of Correct Movement*

---

## Ra's Definition
**Strategy** is the practical tool for living your unique design without resistance. It is not a philosophy or aspiration but a **mechanical law**[^1]—the specific way your Type is designed to move through the world in alignment with its correct geometry.

Strategy aligns your vehicle (the BodyGraph) with its role in the totality. When followed correctly, it rewards you with your Type's **Signature** (peace, satisfaction, success, or surprise). When abandoned, it signals incorrectness through your **Not-Self Theme** (anger, frustration, bitterness, or disappointment).

## The Four Strategies

Each [[Types]] has a unique Strategy:

| Type | Strategy | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| [[Manifestor]] | To Inform | Eliminate resistance by declaring intent before initiating |
| [[Generator]] | To Wait to Respond | Magnetize correct opportunities through Sacral response |
| [[Projector]] | To Wait for the Invitation | Access empowerment through formal recognition |
| [[Reflector]] | To Wait a Full Lunar Cycle | Achieve clarity by sampling all perspectives over 28 days |

## The Mechanics of Each Strategy

### To Inform (Manifestor)

The [[Manifestor]]'s closed and repelling aura creates unconscious resistance in others.[^2] **To Inform** transforms this resistance into transparency. Informing is not asking permission—it is **declaration**: "I am doing this."

When the Manifestor informs:
- Others feel included rather than controlled
- The aura becomes transparent, reducing resistance
- The Manifestor's impact is amplified rather than obstructed
- Peace replaces anger

Informing is the Manifestor's recognition that power without communication becomes tyranny, and autonomy without transparency becomes isolation.

### To Wait to Respond (Generator)

The [[Generator]]'s open and enveloping aura draws life toward them.[^3] **To Wait to Respond** means allowing opportunities to arrive rather than initiating from the mind. The Sacral responds with guttural sounds ("uh-huh" / "uhn-un") or body knowing (expansion/contraction).

When the Generator responds:
- The Sacral reveals what it has energy for
- Correct work magnetizes to them
- Frustration dissolves (the signal of incorrect initiation)
- Satisfaction emerges through mastery of what they love

The Generator's gift is not forcing but **magnetizing**—their aura attracts what is correct when they wait to respond.

### To Wait for the Invitation (Projector)

The [[Projector]]'s focused and penetrating aura reads others with surgical precision, but without invitation, this penetration feels invasive. **To Wait for the Invitation** means being recognized and formally invited into arenas that matter: work, love, partnership, major life decisions.

A correct invitation contains:
1. **Recognition** — The inviter sees the Projector's unique gifts
2. **Empowerment** — The invitation grants access to energy/resources the Projector lacks
3. **Formality** — The invitation is explicit ("I would like your guidance on...")

When the Projector waits for invitation:
- Their wisdom is valued and empowered
- Bitterness (the signal of offering unsolicited guidance) dissolves
- Success emerges—recognition, compensation, correct use of gifts

The Projector's challenge is **sacred passivity**: seeing solutions everywhere but remaining silent until invited to speak.

### To Wait a Full Lunar Cycle (Reflector)

The [[Reflector]]'s completely undefined chart means they have no fixed decision-making center. **To Wait a Full Lunar Cycle** (28 days) allows them to sample every possible energetic configuration as the Moon transits all 64 gates.[^4]

When the Reflector waits 28 days:
- They experience the decision from every perspective
- Patterns emerge that cannot be seen in a single moment
- Clarity arrives through stillness, not force
- Surprise (the signal of authenticity) becomes their compass

The Reflector's gift is **lunar objectivity**—they are not invested in a fixed outcome, so they can see what is truly correct without bias.

---

## Strategy as Alchemy

Strategy is the **outer law** that governs how you engage with the world. It is not about *what* you decide (that is [[Authority]]), but about *how* you enter into decisions and opportunities.

### The Relationship Between Strategy and Authority

- **Strategy** = The mechanics of *how* you engage with life
- **Authority** = The intelligence that determines *what* is correct for you

Strategy without Authority is mechanics without discernment. Authority without Strategy is wisdom without correct timing.

Together, they form the **dual key** to living in alignment:
1. **Strategy positions you correctly** (invitation, response, informing, lunar cycle)
2. **Authority reveals the truth** of what is correct within that positioning

---

## Strategy and the Mind

One of Strategy's primary functions is to **liberate the mind** from decision-making. The mind is designed to be an **Outer Authority**—a tool for observing, articulating, and offering perspective to others—not an Inner Authority that decides for the self.[^5]

When Strategy is followed:
- The mind becomes a **passenger**, observing life unfold
- Decisions originate from the body's intelligence ([[Authority]])
- Mental anxiety decreases (the mind is no longer responsible for controlling outcomes)

When Strategy is abandoned:
- The mind usurps the role of Inner Authority
- Decisions are made from logic, conditioning, or fear
- The Not-Self Theme emerges as somatic feedback

---

## The Signature: Proof of Alignment

Each Type's **Signature** is the experiential confirmation that Strategy and Authority are being honored:

- **Manifestor:** Peace (absence of resistance, internal and external)
- **Generator:** Satisfaction (deep bodily rightness from correct work)
- **Projector:** Success (recognition and empowerment of gifts)
- **Reflector:** Surprise (delight in encountering authenticity)

The Signature is not a goal to chase but a **natural byproduct** of living according to your design.

---

## The Not-Self Theme: Feedback Loop

Each Type's **Not-Self Theme** is the somatic alarm that Strategy has been abandoned:

- **Manifestor:** Anger (when controlled or meeting unexpected resistance)
- **Generator:** Frustration (when initiating instead of responding)
- **Projector:** Bitterness (when offering guidance without invitation)
- **Reflector:** Disappointment (when deciding too quickly or remaining in unhealthy environments)

The Not-Self Theme is not failure—it is **feedback**, a signal to return to Strategy and Authority.

---

## Strategy and Conditioning

**Conditioning** is the process by which the mind learns to override the body's intelligence. From birth, the world teaches us to:
- **Initiate** (don't wait, make things happen)
- **Be certain** (don't admit uncertainty)
- **Prove ourselves** (external validation determines worth)
- **Move fast** (productivity equals value)

These are the strategies of a Generator-majority world conditioned by capitalist urgency and Manifestor-idealized independence. They are **not universally correct**.

### The 7-Year Deconditioning Process

Ra Uru Hu taught that full deconditioning requires **7 years**—one complete cellular regeneration cycle.[^6] This is not metaphor; it is biology. Every cell in your body (except neurons and some heart cells) replaces itself over approximately seven years.

**Year 1-2:** Mental resistance and doubt. The mind objects to Strategy's "illogical" mechanics.

**Year 3-4:** Experiential validation. The body begins to recognize the difference between Strategy (resonance) and Not-Self (resistance).

**Year 5-6:** Cellular integration. Strategy becomes instinctual rather than conscious practice.

**Year 7+:** Embodied alignment. The Signature emerges naturally; the Not-Self Theme fades.

Deconditioning is not linear. You will abandon Strategy repeatedly. The practice is **noticing when you have abandoned it** and returning, again and again, until the body remembers.

### Strategy vs. Societal Programming

Each Strategy contradicts societal conditioning:

- **To Inform** contradicts "Just do it" and "It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission."
- **To Wait to Respond** contradicts "Be proactive" and "Go after what you want."
- **To Wait for the Invitation** contradicts "Put yourself out there" and "Create your own opportunities."
- **To Wait 28 Days** contradicts "Decide now" and "Seize the moment."

Strategy is not moral; it is **mechanical**. The world's strategies work for some designs and fail for others. The question is not "Which strategy is better?" but "Which strategy is correct *for this vehicle*?"

---

## Strategy as Sacred Discipline

Following Strategy requires:
1. **Trust** in the mechanics (even when the mind objects)
2. **Patience** (Strategy often demands waiting)
3. **Discernment** (recognizing when you have abandoned Strategy)
4. **Surrender** (allowing life to come to you rather than forcing it)

Strategy is the spiritual practice of **alignment**—not through transcendence or bypassing, but through embodiment of your unique mechanical truth.

## Cross-References

- **Types:** See [[Manifestor]], [[Generator]], [[Projector]], [[Reflector]] for Type-specific Strategies
- **Authority:** See [[Authority]] for the decision-making intelligence that works *within* Strategy
- **Jungian Parallel:** Strategy as the [[Individuation Process]]—the specific path unique to each psyche
- **Tarot:** [[The Chariot (VII)]] (alignment of vehicle and will) and [[Temperance (XIV)]] (right timing)

---

## Strategy Integration

### For All Types

1. **Learn your Strategy.** It is the first key to living your design.
2. **Observe your Not-Self Theme.** It reveals where you have abandoned Strategy.
3. **Pair Strategy with Authority.** One without the other is incomplete.
4. **Trust the process.** Strategy is mechanical; it works whether or not you understand *why*.
5. **Give yourself 7 years.** Full deconditioning (releasing Not-Self patterns) is a cellular process that requires time.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Manifestors** who fail to inform (creating resistance they could have avoided)
- **Generators** who initiate from the mind (bypassing Sacral response)
- **Projectors** who offer unsolicited guidance (forcing their way into spaces that do not empower them)
- **Reflectors** who make decisions impulsively (without the full lunar cycle)

---

*Strategy is the geometry of your unique movement through life—not a moral code but a mechanical law. When you honor your Strategy, you align with the current of your design, and life becomes less resistance and more resonance. The world does not change, but your relationship to it transforms: you stop fighting the river and learn to navigate its flow.*
