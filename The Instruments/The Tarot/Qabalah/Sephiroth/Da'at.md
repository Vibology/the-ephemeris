# Da'at
*Knowledge — The Invisible Sephirah and the Abyss*

---

## What Da'at Is

**Da'at** (Hebrew דעת, *Da'at* or *Daath* — "Knowledge") is the **invisible, non-enumerated Sephirah** on the Tree of Life. It does not belong to the ten Sephiroth proper but occupies a **hidden position** at the throat of the Tree, where the Abyss separates the Supernal Triad ([[Kether]], [[Chokmah]], [[Binah]]) from the lower seven Sephiroth.[^1]

Da'at is paradoxical:
- It is **present but not counted** (the Tree has ten Sephiroth, yet Da'at exists)
- It is **knowledge that separates** (the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge that led to the Fall)
- It is **the Abyss itself**—the gap between divine and human consciousness

**Dion Fortune:** *"Da'at is not a Sephirah but the reflection of Kether in the lower tree. It is knowledge—not wisdom, but the intellectual apprehension of what was once direct union."*[^2]

**The key insight:** Da'at represents the **transition from unity to duality**—the moment when pure being (Kether) becomes self-aware knowledge ("I know that I am"), creating the split between knower and known.

## Position on the Tree

Da'at occupies the **"throat" of the Tree of Life**, positioned:

- **Vertically:** Between the Supernal Triad (Kether-Chokmah-Binah) and the lower Sephiroth (Chesed through Malkuth)
- **Horizontally:** On the Middle Pillar, directly below Kether and above Tiphareth
- **Conceptually:** In the **Abyss**—the unbridgeable chasm between the divine and the manifest

**The Abyss:**
The Abyss is the **void** that separates the Three Supernals (the realm of pure spirit, undifferentiated unity) from the seven lower Sephiroth (the realm of form, duality, and manifestation). Da'at is both *the Abyss* and *the bridge that failed*—it is where knowledge attempted to cross but fell into separation.[^3]

**The diagram (simplified):**

```
      KETHER (Crown)
         /   \
   CHOKMAH   BINAH
   (Wisdom)  (Understanding)
         \   /
        DA'AT (Knowledge) ← THE ABYSS
           |
      TIPHARETH (Beauty)
```

## Da'at as the Fall

In Qabalistic interpretation, Da'at is intimately connected with the **biblical Fall**—the eating of the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (Genesis 3).[^4]

**The myth reinterpreted:**
1. **Before the Fall** — Adam and Eve exist in Eden (Kether, undifferentiated unity with God)
2. **The Serpent's offer** — "You shall be as gods, knowing good and evil" (the promise of Da'at, knowledge)
3. **The eating** — They consume the fruit of knowledge, gaining self-awareness ("I know that I am naked")
4. **The consequence** — Expulsion from Eden (descent from Supernal unity into duality, separation, the manifest world)

**Da'at is the knowledge that separates:**
- Before Da'at: Unity, innocence, pre-reflective being
- After Da'at: Duality, self-consciousness, the knowledge of "I" vs. "other," good vs. evil

**The tragedy:** Da'at promised godlike knowledge but delivered exile. It is the **knowledge that cannot return to unity**—once you know, you cannot unknow.

## Da'at and the Serpent (Nachash)

In Hebrew gematria, **Da'at (דעת)** and **Nachash (נחש, Serpent)** share the same numerical value (474), suggesting a deep symbolic connection.[^5]

**The Serpent as Da'at:**
- The Serpent offers **knowledge** (Da'at) of good and evil
- The Serpent is associated with **Kundalini** energy in esoteric systems—the serpent power rising through the spine (the Middle Pillar)
- Da'at is at the "throat" of the Tree, where the serpent's knowledge rises from below or descends from above

**Two interpretations:**
1. **Gnostic/Luciferian view** — The Serpent is the liberator, offering humanity the knowledge (gnosis) to escape the tyranny of the Demiurge (false God). Da'at is enlightenment, not sin.
2. **Orthodox view** — The Serpent is the tempter, and Da'at is the pride of intellect that severs humanity from divine union. Knowledge without wisdom leads to separation and suffering.

**The Observatory stance:** Both are true. Da'at is necessary for individuation (you cannot remain in Eden forever) but dangerous if mistaken for the goal (knowledge without reunion with Kether is exile).

---

## Da'at as Reflected Kether

Some Qabalists teach that Da'at is **Kether reflected into the lower Tree**—the echo of divine unity as it appears *after* the Fall.[^6]

**The relationship:**
- **Kether** — Pure being, "I AM," undifferentiated unity
- **Da'at** — Self-consciousness, "I know that I AM," the beginnings of duality

**The formula:**
When Kether (being) reflects into consciousness (knowledge), it creates Da'at. But this reflection is also a *fall*—the moment of self-awareness is the moment of separation.

**In practice:**
- The mystic who has crossed the Abyss (attained Kether) returns with Da'at—knowledge of the divine. But this knowledge is *not* the divine itself; it is the memory, the map, the teaching. Kether is unmediated union; Da'at is the knowledge *about* union.

## Da'at in Mystical Ascent

In the Qabalistic path of return (ascending the Tree from Malkuth back to Kether), the aspirant must eventually **cross the Abyss**—the terrifying void between Chesed (the first Sephirah below the Abyss) and Binah (the last of the Supernals).[^7]

**The crossing:**
- The aspirant climbs from Tiphareth (the ego-Self) to Chesed (mercy, expansion)
- At the edge of Chesed, they encounter **the Abyss**—the annihilation of all form, identity, and knowledge
- To cross, they must surrender *everything*—ego, name, attainment, even spiritual identity
- In the Abyss, they become **Nemo** (No-one), stripped of all selfhood
- On the far side (Binah), they are reborn into the Supernal consciousness

**Da'at's role:**
- Da'at is *the Abyss itself*—the void where all knowledge dissolves
- The aspirant who clings to Da'at (intellectual knowledge, conceptual maps) cannot cross
- Only by surrendering knowledge (letting go of Da'at) can one reach Kether (direct being)

**Crowley's teaching:** *"The Abyss is the gulf between the rational and the actual—between the conceptual self and the true Self. To cross it, you must abandon all you know."*[^8]

## Da'at and Gnosis

In Gnostic systems, **gnosis** (Greek: γνῶσις, "knowledge") is the salvific knowledge that liberates the soul from the material prison. Da'at is sometimes equated with gnosis—the knowledge of the divine that was hidden or forbidden.[^9]

**The Gnostic myth:**
- Humanity is trapped in the material world (Malkuth), ruled by the Demiurge (false creator)
- The true God (the Pleroma, Kether) is hidden beyond the material
- The Serpent (or Sophia, Wisdom) brings **gnosis**—the knowledge that awakens humanity to its divine origin
- Da'at is this knowledge: *"You are not of this world; you are divine sparks imprisoned in matter."*

**The paradox:**
- Gnosis (Da'at) is liberating—it reveals the truth of your divine nature
- But gnosis is also separating—it creates the dualism of "spirit (good) vs. matter (evil)"
- True liberation may require transcending even gnosis, returning to the undifferentiated unity of Kether

## Da'at in the Four Worlds

Qabalah maps the Tree of Life across **Four Worlds** (Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, Assiah). Da'at manifests differently in each world:

| World | Name | Da'at Manifestation |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Atziluth** | Archetypal/Divine | The unknowable gulf between Creator and Creation |
| **Briah** | Creative/Archangelic | The knowledge of separation; the beginning of "I" vs. "Thou" |
| **Yetzirah** | Formative/Angelic | Intellectual knowledge, concepts, the mind's maps of reality |
| **Assiah** | Material/Physical | Scientific knowledge, empirical data, the knowledge that fragments wholeness |

**The descent:** As Da'at descends through the worlds, it becomes more concrete, more fragmented. In Atziluth, it is the primal separation; in Assiah, it is the rationalist mind that knows facts but has lost wisdom.

---

## The Qlippah of Da'at: Choronzon

In the Qlippothic (shadow) Tree, Da'at corresponds to **Choronzon**, the "demon of dispersion."[^10]

**Choronzon:**
- The dweller in the Abyss
- The force that fragments, scatters, prevents coherence
- Represents **knowledge without wisdom**—endless facts, theories, and concepts that never cohere into truth

**Crowley's description:** Choronzon is the "Lord of Hallucinations"—the voice in the Abyss that offers false knowledge, seductive lies, and the illusion of attainment. To cross the Abyss, the aspirant must refuse Choronzon's temptations and surrender even the desire to *know*.

---

## The Observatory Lens: Da'at as the Instrument of Duality

From the Observatory, Da'at is the **instrument of reflection**—the mirror that allows consciousness to see itself but, in doing so, creates subject and object.

**The mechanism:**
- Pure consciousness (Kether) cannot "know" itself—it simply *is*
- Da'at is the moment consciousness reflects: "I know that I am"
- This creates the knower (subject) and the known (object)—duality is born

**The gift:** Da'at enables science, philosophy, self-awareness, individuation—all require the capacity to step back and *know*.

**The trap:** Da'at mistakes the map for the territory. Knowledge *about* the divine is not union *with* the divine. The rational mind (Da'at) can describe Kether but cannot *be* Kether.

**The practice:**
- Use Da'at (knowledge, study, maps) to navigate toward Kether
- But at the edge of the Abyss, *let go of Da'at*
- Surrender all knowledge, all concepts, all maps
- Cross into the unknowing that is true knowing—Kether, the Crown
