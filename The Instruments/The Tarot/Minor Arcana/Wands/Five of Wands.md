# Five of Wands
*The Lord of Strife*

---

## Traditional Symbolism

According to Waite's *Pictorial Key to the Tarot*, the Five of Wands signifies **imitation, mimic warfare, as of youths who play at battle; hence a strenuous competition and struggle; an affair of honor or a quarrel**[^1] (lawsuits, obstacles, and many similar meanings). When the Five of Wands appears upright, it speaks to the realm of conflict, competition, and the disruption of harmony—the moment when peace is shattered and struggle begins anew.

The Golden Dawn titles this card the **"Lord of Strife"**[^2] and attributes it to **Saturn in Leo**—the planet of restriction, limitation, and discipline (Saturn) colliding with the sign of pride, creativity, and self-expression (Leo). This is an inherently tense combination: Saturn wants to constrain, to prune, to impose limits; Leo wants to shine, to create, to expand. The result is *volcanic pressure*—creative energy that cannot flow freely and therefore erupts in bursts of aggression, competition, or scattered effort.

The card represents **Geburah (Severity) in Atziluth (the World of Pure Spirit)**.[^4] Geburah, the fifth Sephirah, is the sphere of judgment, destruction, and necessary correction. It is Mars at its most martial—the surgeon's knife that cuts away disease, the warrior's discipline that imposes order through force, the pruning that precedes new growth. Geburah is often called "Strength" or "Power," but it is strength through severity, not mercy.

The number **Five** in Qabalah represents disruption, challenge, and the introduction of imbalance. Where Four is stable and complete, Five is *unstable*—it breaks the symmetry, introduces conflict, creates tension. Five is the number that cannot rest—it demands resolution, either by moving to Six (reintegration) or collapsing back to Four (retreat to safety).

This card is often misunderstood as purely negative—"conflict is bad, avoid it." But the Five of Wands teaches a more nuanced lesson: **growth requires resistance**. The muscle that is not challenged atrophies. The skill that is not tested remains theoretical. The self that avoids all conflict remains fragile. The Five of Wands is the *agon*—the Greek term for contest, struggle, the proving ground where excellence is forged through friction.

However, the card carries a warning: *not all conflict is productive*. The figures in the Five of Wands are engaged in "mimic warfare"—they brandish wands, they shout, they jostle for position, but no blood is drawn. This is conflict that *could* sharpen skills and establish hierarchy, or it could simply waste energy in pointless struggle. The question is: *Is this strife forging you, or merely consuming you?*

When the Five of Wands appears **reversed**, Waite identifies **litigation, disputes, trickery, contradiction**.[^3] The conflict becomes more formal, more entrenched—it moves from the field of play into the courtroom, from physical contest to legal or verbal warfare. The Golden Dawn reversal suggests "generous, but quarrelsome and violent" or "cruelty, destruction, and overbearing strength." The reversed Five can manifest as conflict that has lost all pretense of being constructive—it is now simply destructive, motivated by spite, fear, or the need to dominate.

The key teaching: **Strife is the crucible. What emerges depends on whether you are being refined—or merely consumed.** The Five of Wands demands that you engage with resistance, but engage *consciously*, not reactively.

## Divination Use
**Upright:** Strife, conflict, competition, struggle, obstacles. Mimic warfare, contests of skill or will. Verbal disputes, arguments, quarrels. Multitasking that creates chaos rather than progress. Energy abundant but uncoordinated. The exhausting experience of trying to move forward while others block your path—or while you block your own path with scattered attention. Affairs of honor, proving yourself, establishing hierarchy through contest.

*Keywords:* Conflict, competition, struggle, strife, challenge, friction, rivalry, scattered energy, chaos, testing.

**Reversed (per Waite):** Litigation, disputes, trickery, contradiction. Conflict becomes formalized (lawsuits, legal battles) or deceitful (sabotage, underhanded tactics). Cruelty, destruction, overbearing strength. The contest loses its constructive element and becomes purely destructive. Violence, quarrels that escalate beyond sport into genuine harm.

## Esoteric Interpretation

### The Sephirotic Lens: Geburah as the Five

**Geburah** is the fifth Sephirah, titled **Severity** (*Gevurah* in Hebrew, also spelled Geburah). It is the left pillar of the Tree of Life—the pillar of form, judgment, and restriction. Where Chesed (the fourth Sephirah, Mercy) is expansive and giving, Geburah is *contracting and cutting*. Geburah is the principle of necessary destruction.

In the Qabalistic framework, Geburah represents:
- **Judgment**: The discriminating function that separates wheat from chaff, true from false, worthy from unworthy
- **Destruction**: Not as evil, but as *necessary clearing*—the forest fire that makes way for new growth
- **Mars**: The warrior god, the planet of conflict, aggression, courage, and the blade
- **Discipline**: The harsh teacher who demands excellence through rigor
- **The Number Five**: Instability, challenge, the disruption of the stable Four

The number **Five** is the "bad" number in many esoteric systems. Where four is the stable square, five is the *pentagram*—a star with points reaching outward, pulling in multiple directions. Five cannot rest. Five is dynamic but chaotic. Five introduces conflict where there was peace, challenge where there was comfort.

In Pythagorean philosophy, five is the number of *uncertainty* and *crisis*. It is neither the beginning (one) nor the completion (ten), but the *midpoint*—the moment of decision, the fork in the road. Five demands action: you cannot remain in Five; you must either advance (to Six, reintegration) or retreat (to Four, safety).

But Geburah-in-Fire (the Wands suit, Atziluth) expresses the Five as **creative conflict**. This is not the sorrow of loss (Five of Cups) or the intellectual defeat (Five of Swords) or the material hardship (Five of Pentacles)—this is *competitive strife*, the agon, the wrestling match where strength is tested and hierarchy is established.

The Five of Wands teaches that **Geburah is not the enemy but the teacher**. The harsh teacher who pushes you beyond your limits, the sparring partner who does not go easy on you, the challenge that reveals what you are made of. Geburah cuts away what is weak so that what is strong remains.

### The Planetary Expression: Saturn Through Leo

**Saturn** is the planet of time, limitation, structure, discipline, and maturation. Where Jupiter (Chesed) expands, Saturn *contracts*. Saturn is the boundary, the law, the harsh reality check. Astrologically, Saturn governs:
- **Limitation**: The principle of "No," the wall that says "You cannot pass here"
- **Time**: The inexorable march toward death, the recognition that life is finite
- **Discipline**: The capacity for delayed gratification, for doing the hard work even when it's unpleasant
- **Structure**: The skeleton that holds the body upright, the rules that hold society together
- **Maturation**: Saturn is the planet of the elder, the one who has survived and learned through hardship

Saturn is cold and dry, associated with lead, with darkness, with the grave. In traditional astrology, Saturn is the *greater malefic*—the planet that brings suffering, yes, but suffering that *teaches*.

**Leo** is the fixed fire sign, ruled by the Sun. Leo is the Lion—regal, proud, creative, warm, generous, self-expressive. Leo governs:
- **Creativity**: The arts, self-expression, the manifestation of one's unique essence
- **Pride**: The sense of dignity, the knowledge of one's worth
- **Leadership**: The king, the sovereign, the one who rules because they embody the solar principle
- **Joy**: The exuberant, playful, childlike delight in being alive
- **Performance**: The stage, the spotlight, the desire to be seen and celebrated

Leo wants to *shine*. Leo wants to create, to express, to be admired.

**Saturn in Leo** creates a painful dynamic:
- **Pride constrained**: Leo wants recognition, but Saturn withholds it. "You are not ready. You must earn it."
- **Creativity blocked**: Leo has visions, but Saturn says "Not yet" or "Not that way." The creative impulse is *frustrated*.
- **Authority challenged**: Leo naturally assumes leadership, but Saturn denies it—there are others who also want to lead, and they will not yield.
- **The pressure cooker**: Fire (Leo) that cannot escape (Saturn) builds pressure. Eventually, it *erupts*.

The first decan of Leo (0°-10°) is ruled by Saturn in many traditional systems. This is Leo at its most raw, most eager to shine—but blocked by Saturn's cold hand. The result is *volcanic*: pressure builds, and when it releases, it does so *explosively*—in bursts of aggression, competitive fervor, or scattered, chaotic action.

The Five of Wands, as Saturn in the first decan of Leo, represents **creative energy that cannot flow smoothly and therefore erupts in conflict**. You want to build, to create, to shine—but others are in your way, or circumstances block you, or (most often) *you are in your own way*, scattering your efforts across multiple fronts rather than focusing on one.

### The Suit Philosophy: Fire at the Stage of Five

The **Wands** suit represents the journey of the **will** from spark to completion. At the stage of **Five**, Fire encounters *resistance*.

The Ace is the gift. The Two is the plan. The Three is the venture underway. The Four is the celebration of completion. But the Five **disrupts the peace**. The festival is over; the struggle begins again.

At this stage, Fire is:
- **Contested**: You are no longer alone. Others have their own wands, their own wills, their own claims to the territory.
- **Scattered**: Multiple directions, multiple goals, multiple opponents—the fire spreads in all directions rather than burning in a focused beam
- **Frustrated**: The smooth progress of One through Four is *blocked*. Now you must fight for every inch of ground.
- **Testing**: The Five is where your will is *tested*—are you strong enough to prevail? Skilled enough to navigate competition? Wise enough to choose which battles to fight?

The movement from Four to Five in Wands is the movement from **peace to strife**, from completion to renewed struggle. The Four built the temple; the Five is the moment when five different architects arrive, each with their own blueprint, each insisting theirs is superior.

But the Five introduces a crucial teaching: **competition can be constructive or destructive**, depending on how it is engaged. The youths in the card are engaged in *mimic warfare*—they are not trying to kill each other, but to *prove themselves*. This is the agon of ancient Greece: the athletic contest, the poetic competition, the dialectical debate. Through strife, excellence emerges.

The Five of Wands is the archetype of the **training ground**—the dojo where students spar, the debate hall where ideas clash, the marketplace where entrepreneurs compete. The struggle is real, but it is *bounded*—there are implicit rules, a shared understanding that the goal is not destruction but *refinement*.

But when the boundary breaks (the reversed Five), the contest becomes war. The mimic battle becomes real battle. The healthy competition becomes sabotage, cruelty, the will to destroy rather than to prove.

### Numerical Progression and Pattern

The **Five** in any suit represents disruption, challenge, and the breaking of stability.

**What came before:** The **Four of Wands** is celebration, completion, harmony, rest. The structure is built, the foundation is solid, the community gathers in joy. The Four is *sabbath*.

**The transition from Four to Five:** The sabbath ends. The work resumes. But now—*others have arrived*. The territory you claimed is contested. The vision you held is challenged by competing visions. This is the movement from **harmony to discord**, from rest to striving, from unity to multiplicity.

This transition is jarring. The Four was so pleasant—why must the Five intrude? But without the Five, there is no *growth*. The Four is a plateau; the Five is the climb to the next peak. You cannot remain on the plateau forever.

**What comes after:** The **Six of Wands** is victory, recognition, the triumphal procession. If the Five is the struggle, the Six is *winning the struggle*. The Six says, "You fought well. You prevailed. Now receive your reward." The Five is the battle; the Six is the aftermath, when the victor is crowned.

**Position in the arc:** The Five of Wands is the **crisis point** in the Wands journey. The first phase (Ace through Four) was about establishing yourself—igniting, planning, expanding, building. The second phase (Five through Ten) is about *defending and advancing* what you built. The Five introduces competition, obstacle, resistance—and you must learn to navigate it.

The Five is where many fail. They retreat to the Four (safety, comfort, the known) rather than push through to the Six (victory, recognition, the next level). The Five is the *test*—and not everyone passes.

### Rider-Waite Symbolism: A Deep Dive

The Rider-Waite image of the Five of Wands is chaotic and energetic. Let us examine each element:

#### The Five Figures: Youths in Contest

Five young men (or gender-ambiguous figures) are depicted brandishing **wands** in what appears to be a disorganized brawl or contest. They are not fighting with deadly intent—no one is wounded, no blood is drawn—but they are *contending*.

The **five figures** represent:
- **Multiplicity**: You are no longer alone. Others have entered the field.
- **Competition**: Each figure wants something—recognition, territory, victory—and they are in each other's way
- **Youth**: These are not seasoned warriors but *youths*—enthusiastic, energetic, but also inexperienced, reckless
- **Equals**: No one figure dominates. They are all roughly matched, which creates the stalemate.

The figures are often depicted as **overlapping, chaotic, uncoordinated**—wands crossing at random angles, bodies in awkward stances. This is not a *duel* (one against one, clear structure) but a *free-for-all* (everyone against everyone, no structure).

The **chaos** suggests:
- **Scattered energy**: Everyone is expending effort, but no one is making progress
- **Lack of coordination**: There is no plan, no strategy—just raw collision
- **Mock battle**: This has the *appearance* of serious conflict, but it may be more performance than substance

#### The Wands: Brandished but Not Bloodied

The **wands** are raised, crossed, brandished—but they do not appear to be *connecting*. No one is struck. No one falls.

The **wands as weapons (but not deadly)** signify:
- **Symbolic conflict**: This is not literal violence but *metaphorical* violence—verbal arguments, competitive jostling, ego clashes
- **Testing strength**: The wands are *measuring rods*—who is strongest? Who will yield?
- **Creative force turned aggressive**: These are wands (creative will), not swords (cutting intellect) or clubs (brute force). The conflict is about *whose will prevails*.

The fact that the wands are **not connecting** suggests:
- **Futility**: Much motion, little effect
- **Posturing**: Perhaps the conflict is more about *appearing* strong than *being* strong
- **Training**: This is practice, not war. The blows are pulled.

#### The Setting: Open Field, No Boundaries

The figures stand in an **open landscape**—no walls, no structure, no referee or authority figure visible.

The **open, unstructured space** signifies:
- **Lack of rules**: No one is officiating this contest. There are no clear boundaries, no agreed-upon terms.
- **Freedom but also chaos**: The openness allows for dynamic movement but also for *disorder*
- **The wild**: This is not civilization (as in the Four's garden) but the *threshold* of wilderness—where structure breaks down

The lack of a referee or authority figure suggests that **no one is in charge**—this is a *peer conflict*, not a hierarchical one. Everyone is equal, which means everyone is competing.

#### The Postures: Disarray and Effort

The figures' **postures** are awkward, strained, off-balance. They are exerting effort, but they are not in *control*.

The **awkward postures** signify:
- **Struggle**: This is hard. It takes effort. No one is breezing through.
- **Inexperience**: These are not masters but students—they have not yet learned grace under pressure
- **Scattered attention**: Each figure is focused on their own wand, their own opponent, without seeing the whole field

#### The Colors: Fire and Earth

The dominant colors are often **red, orange, yellow** (fire) and **brown, green** (earth, the ground they stand on).

- **Fire colors (red/orange/yellow)**: Passion, aggression, energy, heat
- **Earth colors (brown/green)**: The ground beneath, the reality that constrains the fire

The color palette suggests **fire that wants to rise but is pulled down by gravity**—energy that wants to soar but is caught in mundane struggle.

#### The Sky: Often Pale or Absent

In many versions, the sky is pale, washed out, or barely visible—the focus is entirely on the figures and their conflict.

The **muted sky** suggests:
- **No divine intervention**: The heavens are not watching, not intervening. You are on your own.
- **Loss of higher perspective**: When caught in strife, you lose sight of the bigger picture

### Esoteric and Cross-Tradition Parallels

The Five of Wands resonates across multiple wisdom traditions:

#### The Greek Agon: Contest as Path to Excellence

In ancient Greece, the **agon** (ἀγών) was the central concept of competitive striving. Athletic contests (the Olympics), poetic competitions (drama festivals), and philosophical debates (Socratic dialogues) were all forms of *agon*—structured conflict where excellence was proven through challenge.

The Five of Wands is the *agon*. It teaches that **you do not become excellent in isolation**—you become excellent by testing yourself against worthy opponents. The wrestler grows strong by wrestling stronger opponents. The debater sharpens their logic by facing sharper logicians.

But the agon requires *rules*, *boundaries*, *respect*. Without these, it degrades into mere violence.

#### The Alchemical Calcinatio: Purification Through Fire

In alchemy, **calcinatio** is the process of heating a substance until impurities are burned away, leaving only the essential matter. The Five of Wands is psychological calcinatio—the friction, the heat, the conflict that burns away what is weak, leaving what is strong.

Jung wrote about calcinatio as the necessary suffering that transforms the ego—the "burning away of desire" that allows the Self to emerge. The Five of Wands is this burning. It is painful. But it is necessary.

#### The Buddhist Concept of Dukkha: Friction as Teacher

In Buddhism, **dukkha** (suffering, unsatisfactoriness, friction) is the first noble truth. All life involves friction—between what is and what we want to be. The Five of Wands is *dukkha* made visible: the constant rubbing of will against will, desire against obstacle.

Buddhism teaches that dukkha is not to be *avoided* (that would be impossible) but *understood*. The Five of Wands asks: *What is this friction teaching you?*

#### The I Ching Hexagram 6: Conflict (Song)

In the *I Ching*, **Hexagram 6** (訟 *Song*, "Conflict") represents dispute, litigation, and the danger of prolonged struggle. The hexagram structure is Heaven over Water—the creative above, the dangerous below, suggesting that conflict arises when high intentions meet treacherous circumstances.

The *Judgment* says: "Conflict. You are sincere and are being obstructed. A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune. Going through to the end brings misfortune."

The Five of Wands and Hexagram 6 both teach that **not all conflicts should be fought to the finish**. Sometimes the wise path is to disengage, to recognize that the struggle is consuming more than it is producing.

#### The Roman Gladiator: Combat as Spectacle and Training

Roman **gladiators** were not (usually) fighting to the death—most bouts were *staged* combat, meant to demonstrate skill, courage, and discipline. The crowd wanted a good show, not a massacre. The Five of Wands has this quality: *mimic warfare*, combat as performance, struggle that is real but not fatal.

But when the combat became *real* (thumbs down, *ad mortem*), it ceased to be sport and became tragedy. The reversed Five is when the gladiatorial bout turns lethal.

### Psychological and Jungian Depth

In Jungian psychology, the Five of Wands represents **the ego encountering resistance**—from the external world (competition, obstacles) or from the internal world (conflicting desires, competing archetypes).

#### The Ego and the Principle of Friction

Jung taught that psychological growth occurs at the *friction point*—where the conscious ego encounters the unconscious material it has been avoiding. This encounter is not pleasant. The unconscious does not yield gracefully. There is *struggle*, *resistance*, *conflict*.

The Five of Wands is this friction. It is the moment when you realize that individuation is not a smooth, gentle unfolding but a *wrestling match*—you must grapple with the archetypes, the complexes, the shadow. They will not integrate simply because you wish them to. You must *contend* with them.

#### The Geburah Archetype: The Harsh Teacher

In Jungian terms, Geburah corresponds to the archetype of the **Harsh Teacher** or the **Demanding Father**—not the nurturing parent (Chesed) but the one who pushes you beyond your limits, who refuses to coddle, who says "You can do better."

The Five of Wands appears when you need this harsh teaching. The easy path is closed. You must take the hard path—and the hard path involves struggle, competition, friction. But this is how you grow strong.

#### The Individuation Process: Multiple Selves in Conflict

In the context of **Individuation**, the Five of Wands often represents the stage when **multiple sub-personalities or archetypes vie for dominance**. You are no longer a unified self (if you ever were)—you are a *committee* of selves, each with their own agenda, each demanding airtime.

- The Artist wants to create; the Provider wants to earn money
- The Adventurer wants to explore; the Protector wants to stay safe
- The Lover wants relationship; the Hermit wants solitude

These are not *enemies*—they are all *you*. But they are in conflict. The Five of Wands is the cacophony of inner voices, each brandishing their wand, each insisting they know the right path.

The task is not to *silence* them but to become the referee—to create space where each can be heard, where their claims can be weighed, where a synthesis can emerge (the Six).

#### Shadow Expressions of the Five of Wands

When unconscious or rejected, the Five of Wands manifests pathologically:

- **Competition as addiction**: The constant need to prove yourself, to win, to dominate. The person who cannot *not* compete—every conversation becomes a debate, every interaction a contest. This is insecurity disguised as strength.

- **Displaced aggression**: You are angry at X, but you cannot confront X, so you pick fights with Y, Z, and everyone else. The Five becomes *misdirected* conflict—you are swinging your wand, but at the wrong target.

- **Paralysis by options**: Too many paths, too many voices, too many directions—and so you do *nothing*. The Five becomes *stuckness*, the inability to choose because every choice means abandoning other choices.

- **Sabotage**: The person who undermines others rather than building themselves up. If I cannot win, no one will. The reversed Five—trickery, deceit, cruelty.

- **Internal civil war**: The psyche at war with itself. The part that wants to heal fighting the part that clings to the wound. The part that wants growth fighting the part that wants safety. Exhaustion without progress.

- **Perpetual crisis**: Some people become addicted to the drama of conflict—they create it where it does not exist because they feel *alive* in struggle. Calm feels like death. The Five becomes a lifestyle.

### The Gift of Integration

When the Five of Wands is consciously integrated, it offers these gifts:

**Healthy Competition**: The ability to compete without losing your soul. You can enter the arena, test yourself against others, and emerge *strengthened* rather than embittered. Competition becomes a tool for growth, not a threat to identity.

**Discernment About Battles**: The integrated Five knows which fights to fight. Not every challenge demands engagement. Some struggles are productive (they sharpen skills, they clarify values); others are merely draining. The wise person chooses their battles.

**Tolerance for Friction**: The recognition that growth *requires* resistance. The integrated Five does not avoid conflict but *engages it consciously*. You are no longer afraid of the hard conversation, the difficult challenge, the worthy opponent.

**The Capacity to Referee Internal Conflict**: When multiple parts of yourself are in conflict, the integrated Five can step back and *observe* rather than be torn apart. You become the witness to your own inner struggle, creating space for synthesis to emerge.

**Resilience**: The muscle that is worked grows strong. The Five of Wands, when integrated, creates *psychological resilience*—the capacity to withstand pressure, to recover from setbacks, to keep going even when the path is blocked.

### Relationship to Adjacent Cards

**Preceding Card: [[Four of Wands]]**
The Four of Wands is celebration, completion, harmony, rest—the festival after the harvest. The Four is *sabbath*. The Five of Wands is the *end of sabbath*—the return to work, the resumption of struggle. The Four was communal joy; the Five is competitive strife. The Four built the temple; the Five fights over who controls it.

**Following Card: [[Six of Wands]]**
The Six of Wands is victory, recognition, the triumphal procession. If the Five is the battle, the Six is *winning* the battle. The Five is the struggle; the Six is the reward for prevailing in that struggle. The Five tests you; the Six celebrates that you passed the test.

#### Corresponding Cards in Other Suits
- **[[Five of Cups]]** (Water): Emotional loss, grief, mourning. Where Wands fights, Cups grieves.
- **[[Five of Swords]]** (Air): Intellectual defeat, hollow victory, cruelty. Where Wands competes (sometimes healthily), Swords *destroys*.
- **[[Five of Pentacles]]** (Earth): Material hardship, poverty, exclusion. Where Wands has *too much* energy (scattered, chaotic), Pentacles has *too little* (lack, deprivation).

All Fives represent **disruption and challenge**. The Five of Wands is the most *dynamic* of the Fives—it is active struggle, not passive suffering.

### The Central Paradox: Conflict as Crucible

The ultimate mystery of the Five of Wands is this: **The struggle you resist is often the struggle that will make you.**

We live in a culture that pathologizes conflict, that sees all struggle as "toxic," that seeks to eliminate friction in the name of "wellness." The Five of Wands teaches a harder wisdom: *Some conflict is necessary. Some friction is holy.*

The Five asks: *What if the obstacle is not in your way, but IS the way?* What if the resistance you face is not something to be avoided but something to be *engaged*, because engagement is how you become who you are meant to be?

The card does not promise that all struggle is productive. Some struggles are indeed pointless, draining, destructive (the reversed Five). But *some* struggles are the crucible where the soul is forged.

The Five of Wands is the test: *Can you tell the difference?*
