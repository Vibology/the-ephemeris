# Firdaria

*The Planetary Chapters of a Life*

## Archetypal Essence

**Firdaria** (singular *firdar*; also spelled *alfridaries*, *alfridary*) is a time-lord technique of **Persian and medieval** origin that assigns successive chapters of life to the seven visible planets, each governing a specific span of years. The planet ruling the current period — the **Lord of the Firdar** — colors the quality, concerns, and developmental thrust of that chapter[^1].

Where [[Annual Profections|profections]] cycle through the twelve signs yearly and [[Zodiacal Releasing|zodiacal releasing]] maps life-chapters from the Lots, firdaria provides a simpler, broader framework: the entire lifespan divided into planetary chapters, each stamped with the character of its ruling planet. The technique answers the question: *Whose time is it?*

The firdaria system is **not Hellenistic** — it was developed during the transmission of Greek astrology through Persia under the Sassanian Empire (3rd–7th century CE) and crystallized in the Arabic period by authors such as Abu Ma'shar. Brennan notes that Hellenistic texts like those of Dorotheus and Valens were translated into Pahlavi (Middle Persian) and later into Arabic, and new techniques — including firdaria — emerged during this transmission[^2].

## Lilly's Septennial System

William Lilly documents the firdaria in *Christian Astrology* (1647) under the name **Alfridary** or "Lords of the Septenniall yeers." Lilly's version assigns **equal 7-year periods** to each planet in the Chaldean order, with the starting planet determined by sect[^3].

### Diurnal (Day) Nativities

Beginning with the **Sun** (the sect light of the day chart):

| Period | Planet | Ages |
|--------|--------|------|
| 1st | Sun | 0–7 |
| 2nd | Venus | 7–14 |
| 3rd | Mercury | 14–21 |
| 4th | Moon | 21–28 |
| 5th | Saturn | 28–35 |
| 6th | Jupiter | 35–42 |
| 7th | Mars | 42–49 |

The cycle repeats from the Sun at age 49.

### Nocturnal (Night) Nativities

Beginning with the **Moon** (the sect light of the night chart):

| Period | Planet | Ages |
|--------|--------|------|
| 1st | Moon | 0–7 |
| 2nd | Saturn | 7–14 |
| 3rd | Jupiter | 14–21 |
| 4th | Mars | 21–28 |
| 5th | Sun | 28–35 |
| 6th | Venus | 35–42 |
| 7th | Mercury | 42–49 |

The cycle repeats from the Moon at age 49.

### Key Observations

- **Sect determines the starting planet.** Day births begin with the Sun; night births begin with the Moon. This honors the fundamental Hellenistic principle of sect — the day/night distinction that pervades traditional astrology.
- **The Chaldean order governs the sequence.** After the sect light, the planets follow in descending order of apparent speed: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (cycling as needed from the starting point).
- **Seven-year chapters mirror natural development.** The first period (0–7) belongs to the sect light — the foundational imprint. The subsequent periods cycle through the remaining planets, each coloring a seven-year phase of development.
- **Lilly is brief.** He describes firdaria as the system of the *Chronocrator* (Time Lord) but refers readers to Schoner, Junctinus, Ranzovius, and Origanus for detailed interpretation[^3].

## The Standard Medieval System (Variable Years)

The more widely known medieval firdaria tradition, associated with **Abu Ma'shar** (9th century CE) and later codified by **Al-Biruni**, uses **variable-length periods** based on the planetary years rather than Lilly's equal 7-year septennials. This system also includes periods for the **Lunar Nodes**[^4].

### Diurnal Sequence

| Order | Planet | Years | Cumulative |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1st | Sun | 10 | 0–10 |
| 2nd | Venus | 8 | 10–18 |
| 3rd | Mercury | 13 | 18–31 |
| 4th | Moon | 9 | 31–40 |
| 5th | Saturn | 11 | 40–51 |
| 6th | Jupiter | 12 | 51–63 |
| 7th | Mars | 7 | 63–70 |
| 8th | North Node | 3 | 70–73 |
| 9th | South Node | 2 | 73–75 |

### Nocturnal Sequence

| Order | Planet | Years | Cumulative |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1st | Moon | 9 | 0–9 |
| 2nd | Saturn | 11 | 9–20 |
| 3rd | Jupiter | 12 | 20–32 |
| 4th | Mars | 7 | 32–39 |
| 5th | Sun | 10 | 39–49 |
| 6th | Venus | 8 | 49–57 |
| 7th | Mercury | 13 | 57–70 |
| 8th | North Node | 3 | 70–73 |
| 9th | South Node | 2 | 73–75 |

**Total: 75 years.** After the full cycle, it begins again from the sect light.

### Sub-Periods

Each planetary period is divided into **seven sub-periods**, one for each planet in Chaldean order, beginning with the lord of the major period. Each sub-period lasts the major period's duration divided by seven.

**Example:** The Sun's 10-year period divides into 7 sub-periods of approximately 1 year, 5 months each. The first sub-period is Sun/Sun, then Sun/Venus, Sun/Mercury, etc., following the Chaldean sequence from the major lord.

The nodal periods (North Node: 3 years, South Node: 2 years) are also subdivided, though their interpretation follows the node's signification rather than planetary character.

## Interpretation

### The Lord of the Firdar

The planet ruling the current period determines the **dominant theme** of that chapter:

- **Sun period:** Identity consolidation, authority, visibility, vitality. The ego's project is central.
- **Moon period:** Emotional life, home, family, the body's needs. The inner world takes precedence.
- **Mercury period:** Learning, communication, commerce, intellectual development. The mind is active.
- **Venus period:** Relationships, beauty, pleasure, values. Desire and attraction are central concerns.
- **Mars period:** Conflict, assertion, ambition, physical energy. The warrior's chapter — active, combative, driven.
- **Jupiter period:** Expansion, opportunity, faith, wisdom. The broadening of horizons and worldview.
- **Saturn period:** Limitation, responsibility, maturation, reckoning. The chapter of consequence and endurance.
- **North Node period:** Increase, expansion of fate's threads, encounters with destiny. Amplification of whatever the natal chart promises.
- **South Node period:** Decrease, release, diminishment, endings. The winding-down before a new cycle.

### The Critical Variable: Natal Condition

The quality of a firdaria period depends entirely on the **natal condition** of its ruling planet. A Jupiter period in a chart where Jupiter is dignified, well-aspected, and angular delivers genuine expansion and opportunity. A Jupiter period where Jupiter is debilitated, combust, or in a difficult house delivers the *shadow* of Jupiter — overextension, false promises, misplaced faith.

The technique tells you *whose time it is*; the natal chart tells you *what that planet has to offer*.

### Layering with Other Techniques

Firdaria functions best as a **background rhythm** layered with more precise techniques:

- **[[Annual Profections]]** identify the Lord of the Year within the firdaria chapter.
- **Transits** reveal the specific activation events.
- **[[Zodiacal Releasing]]** maps the narrative arc from the Lots, providing a different (and often more precise) chapter structure.

When the firdaria lord, the Lord of the Year (profections), and a significant transit all activate the same planet, the convergence signals a period of concentrated biographical significance.

## Psychological Depth

The firdaria maps a **developmental rhythm** — the idea that human life unfolds through distinct planetary chapters, each demanding engagement with a different archetypal principle. This resonates with developmental psychology's observation that different life stages foreground different psychological tasks.

The day chart sequence is revealing: **Sun** (0–7/0–10) begins with identity and paternal imprint; **Venus** (7–14/10–18) moves to desire, beauty, and the first stirrings of attraction; **Mercury** (14–21/18–31) foregrounds learning, language, and the mind's development; **Moon** (21–28/31–40) returns to emotional life, family formation, and the body's needs. The sequence mirrors natural developmental phases without being rigidly biographical.

The night chart reverses the emphasis: beginning with **Moon** (emotional/maternal imprint), then moving to **Saturn** (early encounter with limitation), **Jupiter** (adolescent expansion and faith), **Mars** (the young adult's assertion and ambition). The nocturnal native encounters the heavyweight planets earlier in life — Saturn and Mars before midlife — which may correspond to early encounters with difficulty, limitation, and conflict that temper the personality before the lighter planets arrive.

In Jungian terms, the firdaria lord is the **dominant complex** of the period — the archetypal principle that organizes psychic life during that chapter. A Saturn firdar activates the Saturnian complex: authority, limitation, the father archetype, the encounter with time. A Venus firdar activates the Venusian complex: desire, beauty, relationship, the encounter with the Other. The sub-periods introduce secondary archetypal flavors within the dominant chapter — Saturn/Venus, Saturn/Mercury — each a specific dialogue between the primary and secondary complex.

## Shadow Expression

- **Fatalistic reading.** Declaring that a Mars firdar will be violent or a Saturn firdar will be depressing without assessing the natal condition of those planets. Mars dignified and well-placed delivers strength and achievement; Mars debilitated and maltreated delivers conflict and injury. The planet's *natal quality* determines the period's quality.
- **Ignoring sect.** Using the day sequence for a night chart (or vice versa) produces incorrect period assignments. Sect is not optional — it determines the starting planet and therefore the entire sequence.
- **Treating firdaria as the only timer.** Firdaria provides broad chapters but lacks the precision of profections (yearly) or zodiacal releasing (from specific Lots). Used alone, it is too coarse. Layered with other techniques, it provides the background rhythm.
- **Conflating the two systems.** Lilly's equal 7-year septennials and the standard variable-year system (Abu Ma'shar) produce different period assignments. They are related but distinct traditions. Choose one system and use it consistently.

## Notes

[^1]: The term *firdaria* (or *firdar*) derives from the Persian adaptation of the Greek *periodos* ("period") and entered Western astrology through Arabic transmission. The system assigns time-lord rulership to successive planets across the lifespan.

[^2]: Brennan, *Hellenistic Astrology: The Study of Fate and Fortune* (2017), Chapter 5: The transmission of Hellenistic astrology through Persia (Sassanian Empire) and into the Arabic tradition. Dorotheus and Valens translated into Pahlavi; new techniques including firdaria emerged during this transmission. Firdaria is not found in the foundational Hellenistic texts.

[^3]: Lilly, *Christian Astrology* (1647), Book III, Chapter CLXVI: "Lords of the Septenniall yeers" (Alfridary). Equal 7-year periods, Chaldean order, sect-dependent starting planet. Lilly refers readers to Schoner, Junctinus, Ranzovius, and Origanus for detailed delineation.

[^4]: The standard variable-year firdaria system is attributed to the Arabic-Persian tradition, particularly Abu Ma'shar (*The Great Introduction*, 9th century CE) and Al-Biruni. The period lengths derive from the planetary years. This is the more widely used version in contemporary traditional astrology practice.
