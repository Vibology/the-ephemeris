# Master Correspondence Index: The Rosetta Stone

*Navigation hub for all cross-system correspondences across the five instruments*

---

## Purpose

This document serves as the **central index** for understanding how Vibology's five instruments correspond to each other:

1. **Astrology** - Planetary timing and cosmic positioning
2. **Human Design** - Individual genetic imprinting and mechanical navigation
3. **Personal Mythos** - Cultural archetypal encoding (Jungian psychology, folklore, mythology)
4. **The Tarot** - Qabalistic pathways and archetypal progression
5. **The Astrolabe** - Contemporary archetypal resonance (I-Ching based oracle)

This is not a complete synthesis document—it is a **map of maps**, showing:
- What correspondences exist (and where to find detailed analysis)
- What correspondences are missing (gaps to fill)
- How to navigate between systems
- Canonical vs. speculative distinctions

## Quick Reference: Primary Correspondences

### The 64-Fold Architecture (Complete)

*Source: [[The 64-Fold Mandala]]*

| # | I-Ching Hexagram | HD Gate & Center | Zodiacal Span | Gene Keys (Shadow → Gift → Siddhi) | Astrolabe |
|---|------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | The Creative | Gate 1 (G) | 13°15' - 18°52'30" Scorpio | Entropy → Freshness → Beauty | Card 01 |
| 13 | Fellowship | Gate 13 (G) | 13°15' - 18°52'30" Aquarius | Discord → Discernment → Empathy | Card 13 |
| 25 | Innocence | Gate 25 (G) | 28°15' Pisces - 3°52'30" Aries | Constriction → Acceptance → Universal Love | Card 25 |
| ... | *[See full table in detail doc]* | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Key insight:** This is **structural identity**, not analogy. The 64 hexagrams ARE the 64 gates ARE the 64 Codex cards. Same architecture, different observation lenses.

### The 22 Major Arcana (Complete)

*Source: [[Cross-System Correspondence - Tarot, Astrology, Human Design]]*

| Tarot Key | Traditional Astrology | HD Gate & Center | Zodiacal Span | Convergence/Divergence |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 0 - The Fool | Air / Uranus | Ajna & Sacral Centers | Multiple (center-level) | **STRUCTURAL** - consciousness-manifestation axis |
| 1 - The Magician | Mercury ☿ | Gate 62 (Throat) | 7°30' - 13°07'30" Taurus | **CONVERGENCE** - Mercury in Taurus exaltation |
| 13 - Death | Scorpio ♏︎ | Gate 7 (G) | 24°30' Virgo - 0°07'30" Libra | **DIVERGENCE** - transformation vs. role discernment |
| 19 - The Sun | Sun ☉ | Gate 13 (G) | 13°15' - 18°52'30" Aquarius | **CONVERGENCE** - radiant witness to humanity |
| ... | *[See full table in detail doc]* | ... | ... | ... |

**Key insight:** Convergences show mechanical precision (all systems point to same truth). Divergences show multi-dimensional complexity (systems observe different angles).

### The 12-Fold Zodiac

| Sign | Zodiacal Arc | HD Gates in This Sign | Element | Modality | Planetary Ruler |
|------|--------------|----------------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Aries ♈︎ | 0° - 30° | Gates 25, 51, 38, 39, 52, 53 | Fire | Cardinal | Mars |
| Taurus ♉︎ | 30° - 60° | Gates 5, 62, 16, 20, 8 | Earth | Fixed | Venus |
| Gemini ♊︎ | 60° - 90° | Gates 8, 20, 45, 12, 35, 56 | Air | Mutable | Mercury |
| Cancer ♋︎ | 90° - 120° | Gates 56, 3, 27, 29, 59 | Water | Cardinal | Moon |
| Leo ♌︎ | 120° - 150° | Gates 59, 3/4, 14, 4, 15, 31, 33, 40, 42 | Fire | Fixed | Sun |
| Virgo ♍︎ | 150° - 180° | Gates 46, 57, 7, 47 | Earth | Mutable | Mercury |
| Libra ♎︎ | 180° - 210° | Gates 47, 2, 6, 44, 48 | Air | Cardinal | Venus |
| Scorpio ♏︎ | 210° - 240° | Gates 48, 50, 28, 1, 22, 23, 18 | Water | Fixed | Mars/Pluto |
| Sagittarius ♐︎ | 240° - 270° | Gates 24, 21, 26, 30, 34, 43, 55 | Fire | Mutable | Jupiter |
| Capricorn ♑︎ | 270° - 300° | Gates 43/49, 60 | Earth | Cardinal | Saturn |
| Aquarius ♒︎ | 300° - 330° | Gates 10, 55, 13, 54, 61, 63, 64 | Air | Fixed | Saturn/Uranus |
| Pisces ♓︎ | 330° - 360° | Gates 11, 25, 37 | Water | Mutable | Jupiter/Neptune |

**Key insight:** Each zodiacal sign contains 5-6 gates (64 gates ÷ 12 signs ≈ 5.3 gates per sign). Gates inherit the elemental/modal qualities of their zodiacal position.

### The 9 Centers (Human Design)

| Center | Gates | Element | Function | Chakra Correlation |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Head** | 61, 63, 64 | Pressure | Inspiration, mental pressure to know | Crown |
| **Ajna** | 4, 11, 17, 24, 43, 47 | Awareness | Conceptualization, mental processing | Third Eye |
| **Throat** | 8, 12, 16, 20, 23, 31, 33, 35, 45, 56, 62 | Manifestation | Communication, action, expression | Throat |
| **G-Center** | 1, 2, 7, 10, 13, 15, 25, 46 | Identity | Direction, love, identity, higher self | Heart (not Heart center) |
| **Heart/Ego** | 21, 26, 40, 51 | Motor | Willpower, material resources, tribe | — (no chakra) |
| **Solar Plexus** | 6, 22, 30, 36, 37, 49, 55 | Motor/Awareness | Emotional wave, feelings, desire | Solar Plexus |
| **Sacral** | 3, 5, 9, 14, 27, 29, 34, 42, 59 | Motor | Life force, response, fertility | Sacral |
| **Spleen** | 18, 28, 32, 44, 48, 50, 57 | Awareness | Survival, intuition, health, immune system | — (no chakra) |
| **Root** | 19, 38, 39, 41, 52, 53, 54, 58, 60 | Pressure | Adrenaline pressure, stress, fuel | Root |

**Key insight:** Centers organize gates by function and energy type. Motor centers (Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Root) provide energy. Awareness centers (Ajna, Spleen, Solar Plexus) provide perception. Pressure centers (Head, Root) create drive.

## How to Use the Instruments Together

### The Five Lenses

Each instrument observes archetypal reality from a different angle:

| Instrument | What It Shows | When to Use |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Astrology** | Timing, cycles, celestial influences, universal patterns | When you need to understand WHEN (transits, timing, phases) |
| **Human Design** | Mechanics, embodiment, genetic imprinting, decision-making | When you need to understand HOW (mechanics, strategy, authority) |
| **Personal Mythos** | Psychological patterns, cultural archetypes, story/journey | When you need to understand WHY (motivation, meaning, narrative) |
| **The Tarot** | Symbolic pathways, initiatory progression, archetypal keys | When you need to understand WHAT (current situation, lesson, challenge) |
| **The Astrolabe** | Oracle guidance, I-Ching wisdom, contemplative keys | When you need to understand GUIDANCE (what wants to emerge, contemplative direction) |

### Synthesis Workflows

**Workflow 1: Chart Reading (Astrology + HD)**
1. Calculate birth chart (Astrology) → planetary positions in signs/houses
2. Calculate bodygraph (HD) → same planetary positions activate gates
3. Synthesize: Planets show WHAT energies, signs show HOW they express, houses show WHERE they manifest, gates show MECHANICS of expression

**Workflow 2: Oracle Reading (Tarot + Astrolabe)**
1. Draw Tarot card (if Major Arcana, has HD gate correspondence)
2. Draw Astrolabe card → always has I-Ching/HD/Gene Keys correspondence
3. Synthesize: Tarot shows initiatory lesson, Astrolabe shows contemplative key, HD gate shows where it manifests in body/life

**Workflow 3: Transit Synthesis (Astrology + HD + Tarot)**
1. Note current planetary transit (e.g., Saturn in Pisces)
2. Identify which HD gates are being activated (e.g., Gates 11, 25, 37)
3. Check if any gates have Tarot correspondences (Gate 25 = The Moon)
4. Synthesize: Saturn (structure) in Pisces (dissolution) activating Gate 25 (innocence/spirit) with Moon correspondence = structured surrender to spirit

**Workflow 4: Personal Mythos Integration (All Instruments)**
1. Identify client's natal chart patterns (Astrology)
2. Map to HD gates/centers (mechanics)
3. Identify Jungian complexes (open centers → Section 3), Hero's Journey stage (gates → Section 2), or mythological resonance (Section 4)
4. Use Tarot/Astrolabe for symbolic/oracular layer
5. Synthesize: Complete archetypal portrait using integration workflows (Section 5)
6. Reference: [[Cross-System Correspondence - Personal Mythos Integration]]

## Canonical vs. Speculative Distinctions

### Canonical (Source Authority Exists)

| Correspondence | Source | Status |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **I-Ching → HD gates** | Ra Uru Hu (1987), IHDS Synthesis Index | ✓ Canonical |
| **HD gates → Zodiacal positions** | IHDS Synthesis Index (5°37'30" per gate) | ✓ Canonical |
| **Tarot Major Arcana → HD gates** | Ra Uru Hu (1998), documented by Eleanor Haspel-Portner | ✓ Canonical |
| **Tarot Major Arcana → Traditional astrology** | Golden Dawn/BOTA (Crowley, Case, Wang) | ✓ Canonical (esoteric tradition) |
| **I-Ching → Gene Keys** | Richard Rudd (2009) | ✓ Canonical (within Gene Keys system) |
| **I-Ching → Astrolabe Codex** | Vibology synthesis (2026) | ✓ Canonical (structural identity with I-Ching) |

### Speculative (No Source Authority)

| Potential Correspondence | Why Speculative | Approach |
|-------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Tarot Minor Arcana → HD gates** | Ra never addressed Minor Arcana; 56 cards to 42 ungated locations = no clean mapping | Do not force correspondence; use independently |
| **Personal Mythos → systematic cross-mapping** | No established correspondence system exists | Must be created through original synthesis work |
| **Astrolabe Athanor → other systems** | Deck structure still in development | Map after deck is finalized |

**Critical principle:** When correspondences are canonical (established by authoritative source), use them with confidence. When speculative, either:
1. Create original synthesis with clear methodology, OR
2. Use systems independently without forcing artificial correspondence

*"The Rosetta Stone does not translate—it reveals that multiple languages are describing the same reality. When Astrology, Human Design, Personal Mythos, The Tarot, and The Astrolabe all point to the same archetypal territory, we gain not certainty but depth perception. The instruments do not collapse into one; they create parallax—the ability to see dimension through multiple observation points."*
