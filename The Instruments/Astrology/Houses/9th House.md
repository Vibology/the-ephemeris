# 9th House
*Philosophy and the Quest for Meaning*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **9th House** governs **higher learning**—not facts (3rd House), but *meaning*. This is the house of philosophy, religion, long journeys, and the search for the pattern that orders chaos. It is **Sagittarius's domain**: the ascent to the mountaintop where vision becomes available.

Where the 3rd House gathers information, the 9th House **synthesizes it into wisdom**. Where the 3rd House travels locally, the 9th House journeys to foreign lands. Where the 3rd House learns, the 9th House **teaches**.

Lilly describes the 9th House as governing "long journeys, voyages, religion, clergy, dreams, learning, books, and church benefices."[^1]
