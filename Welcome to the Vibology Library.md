# Welcome to the Vibology Library
*You stand at the threshold of seven wisdom traditions, woven into one.*

---

This archive holds the synthesis of **Angelology**, **Astrology**, **Folklore**, **Human Design**, **The Magdalene Path**, **The Tarot**, and **The Astrolabe** — seven pillars of knowledge that, together, form a map of the soul's terrain.[^1]

The map is not the territory. **You** are the territory.

Use this Library as the **Algorithm**—the external structure that organizes what is known. But always return to the **Anima**—your inner authority, your lived experience, the compass that validates all knowledge through the body.

## The Seven Pillars of Understanding

Each pillar is a complete wisdom tradition. Each contains an Overview as your entry point 

| Pillar                 | Domain                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Angelology]]         | Hierarchical consciousness and divine emanation            |
| [[Astrology]]          | Planetary timing and cosmic positioning                    |
| [[Personal Mythos]]    | Archetypal encoding, Jungian psychology, the Personal Myth |
| [[Human Design]]       | Individual genetic imprinting and mechanical navigation    |
| [[The Magdalene Path]] | The unifying core—vertical soul ascent                     |
| [[The Tarot]]          | Qabalistic pathways and archetypal progression             |
| [[The Astrolabe]]         | Contemporary archetypal resonance (the emotional field)    |

## Notes

[^1]: The Seven Pillars framework represents Vibology's synthesis architecture, integrating traditional wisdom systems (Angelology, Astrology, Tarot/Qabalah, I-Ching), contemporary systems (Human Design), spiritual paths (The Magdalene Path), and archetypal psychology (Personal Mythos/Jungian). See [[Core Foundations of Vibology]] for architectural overview.
