# Left Angle Cross of the Plane (2)

## Gates: 6/36/15/10 | Quarter of Duality

### Ra's Keynote
> "People here to enjoy their work, while enticing us deeply into the material plane, so that we will always have what we need to love living in the social/material world."[^1]

## The Four Gates

### Personality Sun: Gate 6 - Conflict (Friction)
**Center:** Solar Plexus | **Circuitry:** Tribal (Defense Circuit)

Gate 6 is the **law that growth cannot exist without friction**—the emotional diaphragm that regulates intimacy, knowing when to open and when to close. As the Personality Sun, this defines the conscious purpose: to navigate the friction of human relating, to model emotional honesty, and to demonstrate that conflict serves connection. In this Left Angle Cross, this capacity becomes the vehicle for making the material plane desirable.

### Personality Earth: Gate 36 - Darkening of the Light (Crisis)
**Center:** Solar Plexus | **Circuitry:** Collective (Sensing/Abstract Circuit)

Gate 36 grounds the emotional friction with **the wisdom gained through crisis**—the recognition that darkness is cyclical, not permanent. The Earth position reveals that enjoying work in the material plane requires having integrated the darkening, having earned the right to say that life here is worth living.

### Design Sun: Gate 15 - Modesty (Extremes)
**Center:** G (Identity) | **Circuitry:** Collective (Logic Circuit)

Gate 15 operates unconsciously as **love of humanity through the balancing of extremes**—the capacity to experience the full spectrum of human behavior while maintaining magnetic equilibrium. This provides the trans-personal destiny with its quality: a presence that embraces all of humanity, that makes the social/material world feel like home.

### Design Earth: Gate 10 - Treading (Behavior of the Self)
**Center:** G (Identity) | **Circuitry:** Integration / Centering

Gate 10 grounds the love of humanity with **authentic self-behavior**—the natural way one moves through the world rooted in self-love. This unconscious resource ensures that the enticement into the material plane is genuine—the model is living authentically, not performing happiness.

## Cross Theme

The **LAX of the Plane (2)** in the Quarter of Duality carries the archetype of the **material celebrant**—one whose trans-personal karma involves navigating friction (6) and crisis (36) so thoroughly that they can genuinely entice others into loving earthly existence through their humanity (15) and authentic behavior (10).

This is a **Left Angle Cross**, meaning the individual carries a **trans-personal destiny**—their life path is fundamentally intertwined with others in karmic ways. The Plane (2) differs from Plane (1) in its emphasis on bonding: where Plane (1) witnesses and awakens, Plane (2) entices and invites others to love the material world through relationship.

**Profiles:** 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3—all carrying the projective quality of the 5th line or the role-model potential of the 6th line.

This cross bridges three streams:
- **Tribal Defense** (6): The friction that deepens intimacy
- **Collective Abstract** (36): The experiential wisdom of having lived through darkness
- **Collective Logic / Integration** (15/10): Love of humanity expressed through authentic behavior

In the Quarter of Duality (Bonding), the Plane fulfills purpose through:
- The relationships that demonstrate that earthly life is worth living
- The bonds formed around shared appreciation of the material world
- The partnerships that make work enjoyable and life sustainable
- The recognition that the social world is not separate from the sacred

## Quarter Context

**Quarter of Duality | Realm of Jupiter | Purpose through Bonding**

In this quarter, the Plane fulfills its trans-personal purpose through **the bonds that anchor joy in earthly existence**. Jupiter's expansive influence means that the celebration of the material plane is not solitary pleasure but shared abundance. The individual invites others into the recognition that the social/material world provides what we need.

Ra's keynote speaks of "enjoying their work"—this is crucial. The material celebrant is not an ascetic suffering through earthly existence; they have found a way to love their work, to find meaning in the mundane, and this joy becomes contagious. The enticement is not manipulation but authentic demonstration: "See, it is possible to love living here."

## Shadow Expression

- **Conflict avoidance:** Gate 6's capacity for friction becoming fear of emotional honesty, creating superficial harmony
- **Unprocessed crisis:** Gate 36's darkening becoming unresolved trauma that colors the enticing with hidden bitterness
- **Extremes as indulgence:** Gate 15's spectrum-walking becoming hedonism without balance
- **Performed authenticity:** Gate 10's natural behavior becoming another mask, showing what others want to see
- **Material escapism:** Using celebration of the plane to avoid the genuine darkness that must be integrated

---

## Highest Expression

- **Generative friction:** Gate 6's emotional honesty deepening bonds and modeling authentic intimacy
- **Integrated darkness:** Gate 36's crisis having been processed into genuine wisdom about the value of light
- **Magnetic humanity:** Gate 15's embrace of extremes creating space where everyone feels they belong
- **Living authenticity:** Gate 10's behavior as genuine demonstration that self-love is possible and good
- **Sacred materiality:** Showing through lived example that the social/material plane is worthy of love and that we have what we need
