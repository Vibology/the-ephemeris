# 10th House
*Vocation and the Peak of Worldly Estimation*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **10th House** is the **Midheaven** (MC)—the highest point in the chart, visible to all. This is the house of **vocation**: not career (that's 6th House), but *calling*—the work the world recognizes as yours. It governs reputation, public authority, achievement, and the legacy you leave when the Sun sets on your life.

Where the 4th House (IC) is the hidden root, the 10th House is the **visible crown**. Where the 4th House is private sanctuary, the 10th House is **public performance**. What you are at the IC (foundation) determines what you can become at the MC (peak).

Lilly describes the 10th House as governing "honour, dignity, kings, princes, magistrates, the mother, profession or trade, and preferment."[^1]
