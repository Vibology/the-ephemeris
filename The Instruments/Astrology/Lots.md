# The Lots (Arabic Parts)

## Archetypal Essence

The Lots are calculated points — not celestial bodies — that distill the relationship between three chart factors into a single sensitive degree. Where planets occupy the sky by cosmic fact, the Lots are *derived*: they exist only because the astrologer asks a specific question of the chart. The Lot of Fortune asks: *What is the relationship between Sun, Moon, and Ascendant, and where does that relationship land in the zodiac?* The answer reveals something none of the three components could show alone.

The Hellenistic astrologers called them *kleroi* (Greek: "lots" or "allotments"), evoking the casting of lots — the ancient practice of submitting a question to fate and reading the answer in where the token falls. The later Arabic tradition inherited and expanded them as "Parts" (*ajzā'*), and the medieval Latin tradition transmitted them as *partes*. All three names point to the same intuition: there are dimensions of human experience that no single planet, sign, or house can represent, dimensions that emerge only from the *relationships between* chart factors[^1].

The two foundational Lots — **Fortune** and **Spirit** — form a polarity at the heart of Hellenistic chart reading: body and soul, chance and choice, what befalls you and what you do about it.

## The Two Foundational Lots

### The Lot of Fortune (*klēros tuchēs*)

Fortune represents the body (*soma*), material circumstance, health, wealth, reputation, and everything that *happens to* the native — the domain of chance, luck, and physical incarnation. Firmicus Maternus calls it the "Place of the Moon," and Brennan describes it as a "lunar horoscope" — a secondary chart anchored not in the rising sign but in the lunar relationship to the Sun[^2].

**Calculation:**

| Chart Sect | Formula | Measure |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Day chart | Ascendant + Moon − Sun | Arc from Sun to Moon, projected from Ascendant |
| Night chart | Ascendant + Sun − Moon | Arc from Moon to Sun, projected from Ascendant |

The formula *reverses by sect*: in a day chart, you measure from the sect light (Sun) to the Moon; in a night chart, from the Moon to the Sun. This ensures the Lot maintains the same geometric relationship to the Ascendant that the Moon holds to the Sun[^3].

**Significations:** Body, health, physical vitality, material fortune, wealth, reputation, things received passively — what life gives and takes without the native's choosing.

### The Lot of Spirit (*klēros daimonos*)

Spirit represents the soul (*psuchē*), intellect, will, career, and everything the native *does* — the domain of action (*praxis*), choice, and intentional engagement with life. Where Fortune is lunar and receptive, Spirit is solar and volitional[^4].

**Calculation:**

| Chart Sect | Formula | Measure |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Day chart | Ascendant + Sun − Moon | Arc from Moon to Sun, projected from Ascendant |
| Night chart | Ascendant + Moon − Sun | Arc from Sun to Moon, projected from Ascendant |

Spirit is the exact reverse of Fortune. This mathematical symmetry encodes the archetypal polarity: if Fortune falls at 15° Taurus, Spirit falls at the mirror point. Body and soul are always in dialogue.

**Significations:** Soul, mind, intelligence, career, action, choices, discourse, what the native actively pursues and creates.

### The Fortune-Spirit Polarity

Valens teaches that when the Lord of Fortune is well-situated, the native is materially fortunate — wealthy, healthy, physically blessed. When the Lord of Spirit is well-situated, the native is active and industrious — their career prospers, their choices bear fruit[^4]. The two Lots read together reveal the fundamental tension of incarnation: *what you are given* versus *what you make of it*.

This polarity maps onto the [[Sun ☉|Sun]]–[[Moon ☽|Moon]] axis, the conscious–unconscious divide, and in Jungian terms, the ego–Self relationship: Fortune as the given conditions of psychic inheritance (what the unconscious delivers), Spirit as the ego's capacity to work with that material.

## The Seven Hermetic Lots

Paulus Alexandrinus preserves a system of seven Lots derived from the seven traditional planets. Each Lot distills a specific life domain through the relationship between a planet and one of the two foundational Lots[^5].

| Lot | Planet | Day Formula | Night Formula | Signification |
|-----|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Fortune** | [[Moon ☽\|Moon]] | Asc + Moon − Sun | Asc + Sun − Moon | Body, chance, wealth |
| **Spirit** | [[Sun ☉\|Sun]] | Asc + Sun − Moon | Asc + Moon − Sun | Soul, action, career |
| **Eros** | [[Venus ♀\|Venus]] | Asc + Venus − Spirit | Asc + Spirit − Venus | Desire, appetite, friendship |
| **Necessity** | [[Mercury ☿\|Mercury]] | Asc + Fortune − Mercury | Asc + Mercury − Fortune | Constraints, enemies, struggle |
| **Courage** | [[Mars ♂\|Mars]] | Asc + Fortune − Mars | Asc + Mars − Fortune | Boldness, treachery, strength |
| **Victory** | [[Jupiter ♃\|Jupiter]] | Asc + Jupiter − Spirit | Asc + Spirit − Jupiter | Faith, enterprise, success |
| **Nemesis** | [[Saturn ♄\|Saturn]] | Asc + Saturn − Fortune | Asc + Fortune − Saturn | Hidden things, sorrow, exile |

Note the pattern: the benefic planets (Venus, Jupiter) calculate from the Lot of **Spirit** — desire and faith are volitional. The malefic planets (Mars, Saturn) calculate from the Lot of **Fortune** — courage and nemesis arise from circumstance. Mercury (Necessity) also calculates from Fortune — constraints are imposed, not chosen[^6].

## Additional Lots

### The Lot of Basis (*basis*)

The Lot of Basis measures the *shortest arc* between Fortune and Spirit, projected from the Ascendant. Because it always takes the shorter distance (the arc less than 180°), the Lot of Basis invariably falls in the lower half of the chart. Valens uses it alongside the triplicity rulers of the sect light and the two foundational Lots to assess the overall stability and eminence of the nativity — the "foundation" upon which the life is built[^7].

### The Lot of Exaltation

This Lot identifies potential for high rank and distinction.

| Chart Sect | Formula |
|-----------|---------|
| Day chart | Asc + (arc from Sun to 19° Aries) |
| Night chart | Asc + (arc from Moon to 3° Taurus) |

The calculation uses the *exaltation degrees* of the luminaries: 19° Aries (Sun's exaltation) and 3° Taurus (Moon's exaltation). Valens instructs that if the Lord of the Lot of Exaltation falls in the 1st or 10th place, the native may achieve eminence[^7].

---

## Derived Houses from Fortune

Valens treats the Lot of Fortune as a secondary Ascendant, creating an entire derived house system. The sign containing Fortune becomes the 1st derived place, the next sign the 2nd, and so on through all twelve. This system operates alongside the natal houses, revealing a parallel layer of signification anchored in the body and material circumstances rather than the rising sign[^8].

**Key Derived Places:**

| Place from Fortune | Signification |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 1st (Fortune itself) | The body, physical constitution |
| 4th from Fortune | Foundation, home (of bodily life) |
| 7th from Fortune | Partnerships (as they affect material circumstances) |
| 8th from Fortune | Quality and manner of death |
| 10th from Fortune | Reputation, public standing (material) |
| 11th from Fortune | **Place of Acquisition** (*peripoiētikos*) — property, material accumulation |

The **Place of Acquisition** (11th from Fortune) receives special emphasis from Valens: when well-situated — benefics present or configured, its lord in good condition — it indicates material prosperity and the capacity to accumulate wealth. When afflicted, material instability[^8].

The angular places from Fortune (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) are described by Valens as *energesteroi* — "more efficacious" — indicating periods of heightened activity when activated by time-lord techniques.

## Interpretation Methodology

Brennan outlines a four-step protocol for analyzing any Lot[^9]:

### Step 1: Sign
Examine the zodiacal sign the Lot falls in — its element, modality, ruler, and quality. A Lot in a cardinal fire sign manifests differently than one in a mutable water sign.

### Step 2: House Placement
Determine whether the Lot falls in an angular (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th), succedent (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th), or cadent (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th) house. Angular placement indicates strength and prominence for that Lot's significations; cadent placement indicates weakness or hiddenness.

### Step 3: Aspects
Which planets aspect the Lot? Benefics configured to the Lot improve its outcomes; malefics corrupt them. A Lot of Fortune trined by Jupiter prospers materially; squared by Mars, material life suffers disruption.

### Step 4: The Lord of the Lot
This is the most critical step. The planet ruling the sign of the Lot becomes its *lord*, and **the condition of the lord determines the outcome.** A Lot of Spirit in Libra with Venus well-placed (in sect, angular, bonified) indicates a career that thrives through beauty, harmony, and relationship. The same Lot with Venus under the beams, maltreated, and cadent indicates a career that struggles to manifest.

The lord's condition should be assessed using the full [[Planetary Condition]] framework: sect, solar phase, bonification/maltreatment, essential dignity, and counteraction.

## Lots as Timing Tools

The Lots are not only natal indicators but starting points for predictive techniques:

- **Profections from Fortune/Spirit:** Just as the Ascendant can be profected (one sign per year), so can the Lots. Profecting from Fortune reveals the annual rhythm of bodily and material fortune; profecting from Spirit reveals the rhythm of career and intentional action[^10].

- **Zodiacal Releasing (*aphesis*):** Brennan details Valens's technique of "releasing" from the Lots as a time-lord system. Releasing from Spirit reveals career periods and peak activity; releasing from Fortune reveals periods of physical crisis or vitality[^11]. This is among the most powerful Hellenistic timing techniques, and its full treatment warrants its own entry.

---

## The Reversal Controversy

A significant disagreement exists regarding whether the Lot of Fortune should reverse its calculation for night charts[^12]:

- **Ptolemy** appears to advocate a single formula regardless of sect (always measuring from Sun to Moon). His text is disputed — Brennan notes the passage may be corrupt or misinterpreted.
- **The consensus** (Valens, Dorotheus, Paulus, and virtually all other Hellenistic authors) reverses the formula by sect. Brennan concludes that reversal was standard Hellenistic practice.
- **The practical consequence:** Failing to reverse the formula in a night chart means accidentally calculating the Lot of *Spirit* when intending Fortune, and vice versa. The mathematical symmetry of the two Lots makes this error consequential.

---

## Psychological Depth

The Lot system, read through Jungian depth, reveals the chart's engagement with the problem of fate versus free will — the central tension of individuation.

**Fortune as the Unconscious:** The Lot of Fortune is what life delivers without the ego's consent — the body one inherits, the family one is born into, the material conditions that shape the first half of life. In Jungian terms, this is the domain of the [[The Collective Unconscious]] and the given archetypal inheritance. Fortune is not "luck" in the trivial sense but *moira* — the portion allotted, the thread measured by the Fates.

**Spirit as the Ego's Work:** The Lot of Spirit is the ego's response to its allotment — what is done with what has been given. Career, vocation, intellectual pursuit, creative action — all belong to Spirit. The individuation process itself could be understood as the progressive alignment of Spirit's choices with Fortune's givens: learning to *will* what has been allotted rather than fighting it.

**The Hermetic Lots as Archetypal Domains:** Eros (Venus) is the desiring function — what the psyche reaches toward. Necessity (Mercury) is the constraining function — what the mind cannot escape. Courage (Mars) is the assertive function — where the native fights or is fought. Victory (Jupiter) is the meaning-making function — where faith is tested and enterprise succeeds or fails. Nemesis (Saturn) is the shadow of fortune — where loss teaches and sorrow deepens.

---

## Shadow Expression

The shadow of Lot interpretation includes:

- **Fortune-worship:** Treating the Lot of Fortune as a "money indicator" without understanding its full range (body, health, physical fate, material reality). Fortune is not a wish-fulfillment point.
- **Spirit inflation:** Treating the Lot of Spirit as proof that "you create your own reality." Spirit operates *within* Fortune's constraints — will is not omnipotent, and the ego does not manufacture the unconscious.
- **Reversal error:** Using the wrong formula for the chart's sect. This is not merely a mathematical mistake but a conceptual confusion between body and soul, fate and will.
- **Lord neglect:** Calculating the Lot but failing to examine its lord's condition. The degree is meaningless without the lord — the Lot is a *question*, and the lord's condition is the *answer*.

---

## Interpretation Guide

### Calculating the Lots

For a day chart with Sun at 15° Leo, Moon at 20° Scorpio, Ascendant at 10° Aquarius:

1. **Fortune (Day):** Asc + Moon − Sun = 310° + 230° − 135° = 405° → 45° = **15° Taurus**
2. **Spirit (Day):** Asc + Sun − Moon = 310° + 135° − 230° = 215° = **5° Scorpio**
3. **Lord of Fortune:** Venus (ruler of Taurus). Assess Venus's condition.
4. **Lord of Spirit:** Mars (ruler of Scorpio in traditional rulership). Assess Mars's condition.
5. **Place of Acquisition:** 11th sign from Taurus = Pisces. Jupiter rules. Assess Jupiter's condition for material accumulation.

### Integration with Chart Reading

The Lots belong in the middle of the delineation sequence — after establishing sect, chart ruler, luminaries, and [[Planetary Condition]], but before timing techniques:

1. Sect → 2. Chart Ruler → 3. Luminaries → 4. Planetary Condition → 5. **Lots** → 6. Profections / Timing

The Lord of Fortune and Lord of Spirit become key figures alongside the chart ruler and sect light — they are the custodians of the native's material and volitional fate.
