# The Shadow: The Dark Brother and Hidden Gold

## Overview

### Jung's Definition

The Shadow is one of Jung's most essential and misunderstood concepts. In *The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious* (CW 9i, pars. 284 f.), Jung writes:[^1]

> "The shadow personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about himself and yet is always thrusting itself upon him directly or indirectly—for instance, inferior traits of character and other incompatible tendencies."

In *Aion* (CW 9ii, p. 266), he expands this definition:[^2]

> "...the shadow [is] that hidden, repressed, for the most part inferior and guilt-laden personality whose ultimate ramifications reach back into the realm of our animal ancestors and so comprise the whole historical aspect of the unconscious."

Critically, Jung recognized the Shadow's **positive potential**:[^3]

> "If it has been believed hitherto that the human shadow was the source of all evil, it can now be ascertained on closer investigation that the unconscious man, that is, his shadow, does not consist only of morally reprehensible tendencies, but also displays a number of good qualities, such as normal instincts, appropriate reactions, realistic insights, creative impulses, etc." (*Aion*, CW 9ii, p. 266)

## Closing: Jung's Warning

*"Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it. Furthermore, it is constantly in contact with other interests, so that it is continually subjected to modifications. But if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness, it never gets corrected."*[^5]

— C.G. Jung, *Psychology and Religion* (CW 11, par. 131)
