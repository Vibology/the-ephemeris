# The Four Functions
*Thinking, Feeling, Sensation, Intuition — The Compass of Consciousness*

---

## What the Four Functions Are

The **Four Functions** are Jung's model of the four fundamental ways consciousness orients itself to experience.[^1] Described in *Psychological Types* (CW 6, 1921), they represent the **basic operations** the psyche uses to perceive and evaluate reality. Every individual has access to all four, but they develop unevenly — one becomes **dominant** (the "superior function"), its opposite becomes the **inferior function** (the least developed, most unconscious, most problematic), and the remaining two serve as **auxiliary** functions.

The four functions are organized into two pairs of opposites:

**The Rational (Judging) Pair:**
- **Thinking** — Evaluates through logical analysis, cause-and-effect reasoning, impersonal principles. Asks: *"Is this true or false? What does this mean?"*
- **Feeling** — Evaluates through value-judgment, relational significance, personal meaning. Asks: *"Is this good or bad? What is this worth?"*

**The Irrational (Perceiving) Pair:**
- **Sensation** — Perceives through the five senses, concrete reality, present-moment data. Asks: *"What is actually here? What do I perceive?"*
- **Intuition** — Perceives through unconscious pattern-recognition, future possibility, hidden meaning. Asks: *"What could this become? What is the pattern behind the data?"*

> *"Sensation establishes what is actually present, thinking enables us to recognize its meaning, feeling tells us its value, and intuition points to possibilities as to whence it came and whither it is going."* — Jung, CW 6, §958

Jung was emphatic that **"Feeling" is not emotion**. Feeling, in his usage, is a **rational evaluative function** — it assesses the worth or value of an experience with as much precision as thinking assesses its logical coherence. Emotions (*affect*) can accompany any function; feeling is a specific mode of judgment.

## The Architecture of Typology

### The Function Hierarchy

In every individual, the four functions arrange themselves in a characteristic hierarchy:

1. **Superior Function** (dominant) — The most developed, most conscious, most differentiated function. The one you lead with, trust most, and identify with.

2. **Auxiliary Functions** (secondary/tertiary) — The two functions adjacent to the superior function that support it. One is more developed than the other.

3. **Inferior Function** (least developed) — The opposite of the superior function. The most unconscious, most primitive, most contaminated by the shadow and the anima/animus. Both the greatest vulnerability and the potential gateway to [[The Self]].

**The pairing rule:** If the superior function is a rational function (thinking or feeling), it must be supported by an irrational auxiliary (sensation or intuition), and vice versa. The opposites within each pair (**thinking-feeling**, **sensation-intuition**) cannot both be highly developed — if thinking is dominant, feeling is inferior; if sensation is dominant, intuition is inferior.

### The Eight Types (with Attitudes)

Jung further distinguished two **attitudes** — introversion (energy directed inward) and extroversion (energy directed outward) — giving eight basic psychological types:

| Type | Orients To | Values | Shadow Risk |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Extraverted Thinking** | External logic, systems, organizational structure | Efficiency, objectivity | Suppresses personal feeling, becomes rigid |
| **Introverted Thinking** | Internal logic, subjective ideas, theoretical models | Clarity, precision | Loses connection to outer reality |
| **Extraverted Feeling** | Social harmony, collective values, relationships | Belonging, connection | Loses personal values, becomes conventional |
| **Introverted Feeling** | Inner values, personal significance, aesthetic depth | Authenticity, meaning | Becomes impenetrable, misunderstood |
| **Extraverted Sensation** | Sensory experience, physical reality, pleasure | Vitality, presence | Becomes compulsive, addicted to stimulation |
| **Introverted Sensation** | Subjective impression, inner body awareness, memory | Stability, precision | Becomes rigid, stuck in subjective perception |
| **Extraverted Intuition** | Possibilities, new ventures, patterns in the outer world | Innovation, potential | Cannot follow through, scattered |
| **Introverted Intuition** | Inner vision, archetypal images, prophetic knowing | Depth, meaning behind appearances | Becomes disconnected, prophetic without grounding |

## Jungian Analysis: The Inferior Function and Individuation

### The Inferior Function as Gateway

The inferior function — the least developed, most unconscious member of the hierarchy — is, paradoxically, the **most important for individuation**. Marie-Louise von Franz devoted an entire lecture series to it (*Lectures on Jung's Typology*), recognizing that the inferior function is where the personality meets the unconscious most directly:

> *"The inferior function is the door through which all the figures of the unconscious come into consciousness. Our conscious realm is like a room with four doors, and it is the fourth door by which the shadow, the animus or anima, and the personification of the Self come in."* — von Franz, *Lectures on Jung's Typology*

The inferior function has characteristic qualities:
- **Slow and undifferentiated** — Where the superior function is precise and skilled, the inferior function is clumsy, approximate, childlike
- **Contaminated by the unconscious** — It carries archetypal energy; when it activates, it feels numinous, overwhelming, charged with meaning disproportionate to the situation
- **All-or-nothing** — The inferior function does not operate in gradations; it either does not function at all or erupts with compelling, possessing force
- **Connected to the Self** — Because it is closest to the unconscious, it is the function through which the most transformative experiences enter consciousness

### The Midlife Function Reversal

The four functions are central to the **midlife transition**. In the first half of life, the ego develops its superior and auxiliary functions — these are the tools that build career, relationships, and social identity. At midlife, the inferior function begins to demand attention ([[Enantiodromia]]). The thinker discovers feeling; the sensation type discovers intuition; the extrovert discovers introversion:

> *"At the stroke of noon the descent begins. And the descent means the reversal of all the ideals and values that were cherished in the morning."* — Jung, CW 8, §778

This is not a smooth transition. The inferior function, when it activates, often produces **crisis**: the successful executive (extraverted thinking) who collapses into a depression of feeling; the dutiful mother (introverted feeling) who suddenly demands freedom and intellectual engagement.

### The Four Functions and the Mandala

The four functions correspond to the **quaternary structure** of the [[Mandala]]. The cross within the circle represents the differentiation of consciousness into its four modes; the circle represents the Self that contains and transcends all four. Individuation involves developing all four functions (making the cross) while maintaining the centering of the Self (the circle) — the alchemical *quadratura circuli*.

## Shadow Dynamics

### Typological Inflation
Identifying your type and then using it as an excuse: "I'm a thinking type, I don't do feelings." The type system is a map of where development *is needed*, not a permission slip to avoid it.

### The Inferior Function Possession
When the inferior function erupts, it often takes the form of **possession** — the thinking type becomes overwhelmed by primitive, undifferentiated feeling; the sensation type is seized by apocalyptic intuitions. These episodes are not pathology but the inferior function's attempt to enter consciousness. The danger is being overwhelmed rather than engaging consciously.

### Type Prejudice
Each type tends to devalue the functions it lacks: thinkers dismiss feelers as "irrational," intuitive types dismiss sensation types as "unimaginative," and so on. This is projection of the inferior function onto those who embody it naturally.

### Integration Path
Integration occurs through the **conscious, voluntary development of the inferior function** — not trying to make it as skilled as the superior function (impossible and unnecessary) but giving it **time, attention, and respect**. The thinker practices feeling-evaluation; the sensation type cultivates intuitive awareness; the feeler develops logical analysis. The inferior function never becomes fully differentiated, but it can become a **conscious participant** in the personality.

## Practical Application

### Recognition in Life
To identify your function hierarchy, ask:
- **What do you trust first?** When making a decision, do you analyze logically (thinking), evaluate by personal values (feeling), examine concrete facts (sensation), or trust your gut/vision (intuition)?
- **What embarrasses you?** The inferior function is the one that makes you feel incompetent, childish, or overwhelmed. The thinker is embarrassed by emotional outbursts; the sensation type is embarrassed by "ungrounded" hunches.
- **What do you admire and envy?** Often the inferior function is projected onto others who embody it naturally — the thinker who secretly admires the spontaneity of the feeling type.

### Working with the Functions
1. **Map your hierarchy** — Identify your superior, auxiliary, and inferior functions. The superior is easy; the inferior is the one that causes the most trouble and carries the most fascination.
2. **Inferior function practice** — Deliberately engage your weakest function in low-stakes situations. The thinker watches a film and practices articulating what it *meant to them* (not what it was *about*). The intuitive type practices detailed observation of physical surroundings.
3. **Active imagination with the fourth** — In active imagination, invite the inferior function to speak. It may appear as a figure: a child, an animal, a fool, a sage. Listen without judging.
4. **Type dialogue** — In relationships, recognize that conflict often arises from **function differences** rather than character flaws. The thinking partner and the feeling partner are not enemies but **two functions trying to work together**.

## Cross-References

### Within Personal Mythos
- **Jungian concepts:** [[The Transcendent Function]] (mediates between functions), [[Enantiodromia]] (the midlife function reversal), [[The Shadow]] (the inferior function as shadow gateway), [[The Self]] (the wholeness that contains all four), [[Mandala]] (the quaternary structure)
- **Archetypes:** [[The Anima]] / [[The Animus]] (often contaminate the inferior function), [[The Persona]] (built on the superior function)

### Cross-System Integration
- **Astrology:** The four elements — **Fire** (intuition), **Earth** (sensation), **Air** (thinking), **Water** (feeling). Elemental balance in the natal chart mirrors function development.
- **Tarot:** The four suits — **Wands** (intuition/fire), **Pentacles** (sensation/earth), **Swords** (thinking/air), **Cups** (feeling/water). The court cards as function-attitudes.
- **Qabalah:** The four worlds — **Atziluth** (intuition/fire), **Briah** (feeling/water), **Yetzirah** (thinking/air), **Assiah** (sensation/earth)
- **Human Design:** The four motor centers (Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Root) as energy-function analogues; the open/defined center dynamic mirrors superior/inferior function
- **I-Ching:** The four bigrams (old yin, young yang, old yang, young yin) as the quaternary principle
