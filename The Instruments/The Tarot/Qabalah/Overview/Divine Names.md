# Divine Names
*The Sacred Names of God — Sephirotic Invocations and Divine Attributes*

---

## Overview

The **Divine Names** (Hebrew: *Shemot HaKodesh*, שמות הקודש) are the sacred appellations of God associated with each of the ten [[Sephiroth]] on the [[The Tree of Life]]. Each name is not a label but a **mode of divine action** — a specific way that the Infinite expresses itself through a particular Sephirah. To know a name is to know *how God acts* at that level of the Tree.

The Qabalah teaches that the names are not human inventions applied to God but God's own self-disclosure — the means by which the unknowable makes itself progressively known. The Zohar treats the entire Torah as a single continuous Name of God, with each individual name representing a distinct frequency of divine energy.[^1]

## Names as Creative Forces

The Sefer Yetzirah opens with the declaration that God created the universe through "**thirty-two mysterious paths of Wisdom**" — the ten Sephiroth and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.[^2] The letters are not symbols *for* things but the *instruments of creation itself*. God "engraved, hewed, weighed, and permuted" these letters to form all of reality.

The Divine Names are constructed from these letters. Each name is therefore a **formula of creation** — a specific arrangement of creative forces that, when vibrated with intention, activates the corresponding Sephirotic energy. This is why pronunciation matters in Qabalistic practice: the name is not a word about God but a *sound that God makes*.

| 1 | [[Kether]] | [[Eheieh]] | אהיה | I Am / I Will Be | Pure being before all predication |
| 2 | [[Chokmah]] | Yah | יה | The Lord (abbreviated) | Primordial Wisdom, the first two letters of YHVH |

## The Tetragrammaton (YHVH)

The four-letter name **YHVH** (יהוה) — the Tetragrammaton — is the central axis around which all other Divine Names revolve. It is considered the most sacred and most powerful name, traditionally never pronounced (the word *Adonai* is substituted in liturgical reading).

The four letters correspond to the [[Four Worlds]] of Qabalistic cosmology:

| Letter | World | Sephirotic Level | Quality |
|--------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **Yod** (י) | Atziluth (Archetypal) | Chokmah | The Father, the seed, the initial spark |
| **He** (ה) | Briah (Creative) | Binah | The Mother, the womb, receptive form |
| **Vav** (ו) | Yetzirah (Formative) | Tiphareth (and Chesed-Yesod) | The Son, the connecting principle |
| **He** (ה) | Assiah (Material) | Malkuth | The Daughter, physical manifestation |

The Tetragrammaton is not merely present in certain names — it *structures* the entire Tree. The relationship Yod-He-Vav-He (Father-Mother-Son-Daughter) is the Qabalah's fundamental grammar of creation.[^3]

## The Names in Practice

### The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)

The LBRP — the foundational ritual of the Golden Dawn tradition — uses four Divine Names at the four quarters, each vibrated while tracing a banishing pentagram:

| Quarter | Direction | Divine Name | Sephirotic Source |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| East | Air | **YHVH** | The Tetragrammaton in its fullness |
| South | Fire | **Adonai** | [[Adonai ha-Aretz]] (Malkuth) — God as Lord |
| West | Water | **Eheieh** | [[Eheieh]] (Kether) — God as pure being |
| North | Earth | **AGLA** | Acronym: *Ateh Gibor le-Olam Adonai* ("Thou art mighty forever, O Lord") |

The LBRP creates a protected space by invoking divine authority at each cardinal point — the practitioner stands at the center of a cross of divine names, each name holding a different aspect of God's power in balance.

### The Middle Pillar Exercise

The [[Middle Pillar]] Exercise vibrates five Divine Names descending from Kether to Malkuth along the central axis:

1. **Eheieh** (Crown) → 2. **YHVH Elohim** (Throat/Daath) → 3. **YHVH Eloah va-Daath** (Heart/Tiphareth) → 4. **Shaddai El Chai** (Yesod) → 5. **Adonai ha-Aretz** (Feet/Malkuth)

This sequence draws divine light down through the practitioner's body, establishing equilibrium along the central column of the Tree.

## Jungian Parallels

The ten Divine Names can be understood as ten modes of the ***numinosum*** — Otto's term for the experience of the "wholly other" that Jung adopted throughout his psychology of religion.[^4] Each name represents a different *quality* of numinous encounter:

- **Eheieh** — The numinous as pure presence, before any image or concept
- **Yah** — The numinous as sudden insight, the flash of Wisdom
- **YHVH Elohim** — The numinous as understanding, the moment when insight takes form
- **El** — The numinous as grace, unconditional acceptance
- **Elohim Gibor** — The numinous as severity, the encounter with the [[The Shadow]]
- **YHVH Eloah va-Daath** — The numinous as beauty, the harmonizing [[The Transcendent Function]]
- **YHVH Tzabaoth** — The numinous as desire, the pull toward wholeness
- **Elohim Tzabaoth** — The numinous as precision, the analytical lens
- **Shaddai El Chai** — The numinous as vitality, the life-force that animates
- **Adonai ha-Aretz** — The numinous as embodiment, the sacred in the material

## Notes

[^1]: Zohar — The Torah as a continuous Divine Name, with specific names representing specific modes of divine energy (Sefirot) functioning in the universe.

[^2]: Sefer Yetzirah 1:1 — "With thirty-two mysterious paths of Wisdom, Yah, the Eternal of Hosts, engraved and created His world."

[^3]: Zohar — The Tetragrammaton YHVH as the structural formula of the Four Worlds: Yod (Father/Chokmah), He (Mother/Binah), Vav (Son/Tiphareth), He (Daughter/Malkuth).

[^4]: Rudolf Otto, *The Idea of the Holy* (1917) — The *numinosum* as the experience of the "wholly other." Jung adopted the concept throughout CW 11 (*Psychology and Religion*).
