# Eheieh
*I Am — The Divine Name of Kether*

---

## Overview

**Eheieh** (Hebrew: אהיה, "I Am" or "I Will Be") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Kether]]** (Crown), the first and highest Sephirah on the [[The Tree of Life]]. This is the name God reveals to Moses at the burning bush:

> *"And God said unto Moses, 'Eheieh Asher Eheieh' — I Am That I Am."*
> — Exodus 3:14

Eheieh represents **pure being** — existence without attributes, the eternal present tense, the name that refuses definition. It is not "I am *this*" or "I am *that*," but simply **"I Am."** It is the first sound of consciousness becoming aware of itself.

## Source Teachings

### The Zohar

The Zohar identifies Eheieh with Kether — the highest and most hidden Sephirah. In the phrase *Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh* ("I Will Be Who I Will Be"), the Zohar reads a doubled reference: the first *Ehyeh* refers to Kether (the macrocosm, the unknowable source), and the second *Ehyeh* refers to its reflection in the lower Tree.[^1] Between them stands *Asher* ("Who" or "That Which") — the connecting principle, the mystery that links source and manifestation.

This doubling reveals the structure of the entire Tree: Kether at the top is mirrored by Malkuth at the bottom, and between them stretches the whole architecture of emanation. "I Am That I Am" is the Tree of Life spoken in three words.

### The Sound of Being

The Qabalistic Tarot tradition notes that the name Eheieh is "likened in sound and meaning to the breath" — it is essentially an exhalation, the most basic act of a living being.[^2] To vibrate Eheieh is to produce the sound of existence itself before it differentiates into speech. It is the divine breath before the divine word — the *ruach* (spirit/breath) of Genesis 1:2 hovering over the deep.

## The Name in Practice

### Vibration

Eheieh is vibrated in a single sustained tone: **Eh-heh-YEH** (three syllables, emphasis on the last). The practitioner draws breath fully, then releases it through the name, feeling the vibration first at the crown of the head (Kether's position) and then resonating through the entire body.

### In the Middle Pillar Exercise

Eheieh is the **first name vibrated** in the [[Middle Pillar]] Exercise, establishing the crown center. A sphere of brilliant white light is visualized at the top of the head while the name is intoned. This connects the practitioner to the source — the undifferentiated unity from which all other Sephirotic energies descend.

### In the LBRP

Eheieh is vibrated at the **Western quarter** while tracing the banishing pentagram. West corresponds to Water — the element of formlessness, receptivity, and the unconscious. Eheieh at the West invokes pure being as the guardian of the threshold between the conscious and the unknown.

## Jungian Parallels

Eheieh corresponds to the ***Self*** in its most abstract aspect — not the Self as experienced in dreams or synchronicities but the Self as the **ground of being**, the "archetype of archetypes" that Jung described as both the center and the totality of the psyche.[^3]

The ego cannot say "I Am" in the way Eheieh intends, because the ego is always "I am *something*" — identified with roles, memories, and qualities. Eheieh points to the awareness *behind* all identification, the witness that remains when every object of consciousness is stripped away. This is why Kether is "above the Abyss" — it can only be approached through the ego-death that the [[The Abyss|Abyss]] demands.

The burning bush is the perfect image: a fire that burns without consuming, a presence that *is* without becoming anything. The ego approaches and must remove its shoes — must stand barefoot, unprotected, on holy ground.

## Notes

[^1]: Zohar — The doubled *Ehyeh* in Exodus 3:14 as referring to Kether (macrocosm) and its reflection in the lower Tree. *Asher* as the connecting mystery.

[^2]: Wang, *The Qabalistic Tarot* — Eheieh as "likened in sound and meaning to the breath," the Divine Essence of Kether.

[^3]: Jung, CW 9ii (*Aion*) — The Self as "the archetype of wholeness and the regulating center of the psyche," unknowable in itself, inferred from its effects.
