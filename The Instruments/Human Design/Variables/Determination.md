# Determination
*How the brain and body are correctly fueled*

---

## Introduction: The Primary Health System

**Determination** is the first of the Four [[Variables]]—the dietary regimen that correctly fuels the brain and body.[^1] It is calculated from the **Color** of the **Design Sun/Earth** (the unconscious imprint at birth) and forms the foundation of the **Primary Health System (PHS)**.

**The Central Principle:** Determination is **not** about *what* you eat, but the **conditions and circumstances** under which you eat.[^2]

This is the most counterintuitive aspect of PHS. We are conditioned to obsess over nutrition content—calories, macros, vitamins, superfoods. PHS says: **the "how" and "when" of eating matters more than the "what."** The same food eaten under correct vs. incorrect circumstances produces entirely different effects in the body.

**Why Determination matters:**
- It is the **first transformation** in the Variable sequence
- Correct dietary regimen **physically differentiates the brain**, heightening sensory acuity
- It cleans the internal system, allowing the other Variables ([[Environment]], [[Perspective]], [[Motivation]]) to emerge naturally
- It is the most **tangible** and **experimental** of the Variables—you can begin testing it immediately (after living Strategy and [[Authority]] for years)

**The Structure:** There are **6 Colors** of Determination, divided into two categories:

**Lower Colors (1-3) - Conditions:** Focused on the **condition** of the food itself (sequential, selective, temperature)

**Upper Colors (4-6) - Circumstances:** Focused on the **atmosphere/environment** while eating (vibration, frequency, solar timing)

## Historical Context: The Discovery of PHS

### Ra Uru Hu and the Voice (1987)

The entire [[Human Design]] system—including the Variables—emerged from Ra's eight-day encounter with "the Voice" on Ibiza. However, Variables were not the initial teaching. Ra spent the first two decades (1987-2000s) teaching the **surface mechanics**: [[Types]], Strategy and [[Authority]], [[Centers]], [[Gates]], [[Channels]].

**The deeper layer:** Variables (and the underlying Tone/Color/Base substructure) were revealed in the original transmission but held back for advanced students. Why? Because Variables cannot be accessed without first surrendering to Strategy and Authority. Teaching them prematurely would only feed the Not-Self mind's desire for control.

### The Development of PHS (2000s)

In the 2000s, Ra began teaching **Rave Psychology** and **Primary Health System** to students who had been living their design for years. PHS emerged as the practical application of the [[Determination]] Variable.

**The Innovation:** Ra didn't invent "dietary regimens"—Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and naturopathy all recognize that eating practices matter. What Ra contributed was **radical individualization**: 64 hexagrams × 6 colors = **384 possible dietary configurations**, each unique to the individual's Design Crystal imprint.

### The PHS Certification Program

Advanced practitioners trained in PHS use the **Tone/Color/Base matrix** (Advanced Imaging) to diagnose and prescribe specific regimens. This is not guesswork—it's a mechanical reading of the chart's substructure.

**The Claim:** Correct dietary regimen, practiced consistently over **seven years**, produces measurable **brain differentiation**—heightened sensory awareness, sharper cognition, improved immune function, and longevity.[^3]

## The Six Colors of Determination

### Color 1: Appetite (Consecutive)

**Keyword:** Simplicity

**The Principle:** The most primitive dietary system. Color 1 Determination cannot handle **mixtures or complex blends**. The digestive system is designed to process **one thing at a time** in consecutive fashion—like the Paleolithic hunter eating a single kill sequentially.

#### The Practice
- Eat **one food at a time** (monofeeding)
- Finish one item completely before starting the next
- Avoid mixed dishes, sauces, soups, or casseroles where ingredients blend
- Example: Eat the chicken, then the vegetables, then the rice—**sequentially**, not mixed on a fork

**Left (Active) vs. Right (Receptive):**
- **Left:** More tolerance for variety across meals (different foods throughout the day)
- **Right:** Extreme simplicity—may thrive on eating the **same food repeatedly** for extended periods

**Why It Works:** The digestive system differentiates by isolating nutrient streams. When foods are mixed, the system becomes confused, and nutrients are not properly absorbed. Sequential eating allows the gut to **fully extract** what it needs from each item.

**Modern Challenge:** Nearly all prepared foods are mixtures. Restaurants, packaged meals, and home cooking default to complex blends. Color 1 beings must **consciously simplify**—deconstructing meals into separate components.

#### Shadows
- **Obsessive Rigidity:** Turning the practice into a neurotic rule, creating anxiety around every meal
- **Social Isolation:** Refusing to eat with others because "they don't understand my diet"
- **Mental Override:** The mind deciding "this is stupid" and abandoning the experiment prematurely

#### Practical Tips
- Start with **one meal per day** (e.g., breakfast) and practice consecutive eating
- Use separate bowls/plates for each food item
- When dining out, order simple, deconstructed dishes (e.g., grilled meat and steamed vegetables, not mixed stir-fry)
- Track your energy and digestion over weeks—notice if sequential eating reduces bloating, increases clarity

**Historical Parallel:** The **Caveman/Cavewoman** archetype—the simplest, most instinctual way of eating. Before agriculture and cuisine, humans ate what they hunted or foraged, one item at a time.

### Color 2: Taste (Restrictive/Open)

**Keyword:** Selectivity

**The Principle:** Highly selective and repetitive. Color 2 Determination thrives on a **restricted menu**—eating the same foods daily, changing only with the seasons. The body "knows" what it likes and rejects everything else. This is **not** intellectual preference—it's a deep somatic response.

#### The Practice
- Develop a **core menu** of foods your body consistently responds well to
- Eat these foods **repeatedly** (same breakfast, same lunch, same dinner for weeks/months)
- Change the menu only when the **seasons shift** or when the body clearly signals it's time
- Trust the body's "yes" and "no" more than nutritional science or trendy diets

**Left (Active) vs. Right (Receptive):**
- **Left (Open Taste):** More variety within the restricted menu; willing to test new foods occasionally
- **Right (Closed Taste):** Ultra-restrictive; thrives on the **narrowest possible menu** for extended periods

**Why It Works:** The digestive system differentiates by **mastering specific nutrient profiles**. Eating the same foods repeatedly allows the gut microbiome to optimize for those exact inputs. Constantly changing foods forces the system to recalibrate, reducing efficiency.

**Modern Challenge:** We are conditioned to value "variety" and "balanced diets" with diverse nutrients. Color 2 Determination flips this—**restriction creates optimization**.

#### Shadows
- **Orthorexia:** Obsessing over food purity, turning the restricted diet into a moral crusade
- **Fear of Deficiency:** The mind panicking that "I'm not getting enough vitamins" and overriding the body's selectivity
- **Social Pressure:** Others insisting "you need to eat more variety" and shaming the restricted practice

#### Practical Tips
- Identify 5-10 foods your body consistently feels good eating
- Eat these foods **daily** for 3-6 months without deviation
- Notice: Does your digestion improve? Does your energy stabilize? Does your taste become more refined?
- Change the menu only when the body signals boredom or seasonal shifts (e.g., craving warm soups in winter, fresh salads in summer)

**Historical Parallel:** **Traditional agrarian diets**—communities eating the same staple foods (rice, bread, beans) daily for generations, adapting only with harvest cycles.

### Color 3: Thirst (Hot/Cold)

**Keyword:** Temperature

**The Principle:** Temperature manipulation. Color 3 Determination requires food to be either **hotter than body temperature** or **cooler than body temperature** to be properly digested. Eating food at neutral/room temperature disrupts the system.

#### The Practice
- **Hot (Left):** Eat food **warmer than 98.6°F / 37°C**—steaming, freshly cooked, hot beverages
- **Cold (Right):** Eat food **cooler than body temp**—chilled, raw, cold beverages, refrigerated leftovers

**Why It Works:** The digestive system uses **thermal dynamics** to break down nutrients. Color 3 beings are designed to process food through temperature contrast. Lack of thermal correctness prevents proper enzymatic breakdown.

**Modern Challenge:** We often eat food at room temperature (sandwiches, snacks, leftovers left out). Color 3 beings must be **intentional** about temperature.

#### Shadows
- **Obsessive Thermometer Use:** Measuring food temperature to the degree, turning it into a ritual
- **Dogmatic Literalism:** Refusing to eat anything that isn't perfectly hot/cold
- **Ignoring Context:** Eating ice-cold food in winter or piping-hot food in desert heat without body awareness

#### Practical Tips (Hot)
- Eat freshly cooked meals while still steaming
- Drink hot tea, coffee, or warm water with meals
- Reheat leftovers thoroughly before eating
- Notice: Does hot food increase energy? Does it ease digestion?

#### Practical Tips (Cold)
- Eat raw salads, chilled fruits, refrigerated leftovers
- Drink cold water, iced tea, smoothies
- Store prepared meals in the fridge and eat them cold
- Notice: Does cold food feel refreshing? Does it reduce inflammation?

**Historical Parallel:** **TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine)** recognizes "warming" and "cooling" foods as essential to balancing the body's internal thermostat.

### Color 4: Touch (Calm/Nervous)

**Keyword:** Atmosphere

**The Principle:** This is where Determination shifts from **conditions** (Colors 1-3) to **circumstances** (Colors 4-6). Color 4 is about the **vibration/atmosphere** while eating. Calm beings need peace and solitude. Nervous beings need stimulation and activity.

#### The Practice
- **Calm (Left):** Eat in **quiet, peaceful environments** without distraction—alone or with calm companions, soft music, no screens
- **Nervous (Right):** Eat in **active, stimulating environments**—conversation, music, walking, multitasking, busy restaurants

**Why It Works:** The digestive system is intimately connected to the **nervous system**. Color 4 beings absorb the **energetic frequency** of the eating environment as much as the food itself. Wrong vibration = poor digestion, even if the food is "healthy."

**Modern Challenge:** We eat on autopilot—at desks, in cars, in front of screens. Color 4 beings must **curate the atmosphere** as carefully as the food.

#### Shadows (Calm)
- **Social Avoidance:** Using "I need calm" as an excuse to isolate from others
- **Perfectionism:** Refusing to eat unless the environment is "perfectly quiet"

#### Shadows (Nervous)
- **Distraction Addiction:** Eating while binge-watching or scrolling, losing somatic awareness
- **Chronic Overstimulation:** Creating chaos around every meal, never allowing rest

#### Practical Tips (Calm)
- Eat **alone** or with one calm, trusted person
- Turn off screens, phones, notifications
- Sit in silence or with soft instrumental music
- Chew slowly, breathe deeply between bites
- Notice: Does calm eating reduce bloating? Increase satisfaction?

#### Practical Tips (Nervous)
- Eat with **lively conversation** or upbeat music
- Eat while walking, moving, or doing a light activity
- Choose busy cafes or social gatherings for meals
- Notice: Does stimulation while eating increase energy? Improve digestion?

**Historical Parallel:** **Monastic eating practices** (silent meals, mindful chewing) vs. **communal feasts** (celebration, storytelling, song).

### Color 5: Sound (High/Low)

**Keyword:** Frequency

**The Principle:** Sensitivity to **acoustic frequency** during eating. High beings need **loud, vibrant sound**—music, conversation, noise. Low beings need **silence or very quiet environments**.

#### The Practice
- **High (Left):** Eat with **loud music, conversation, or ambient noise**—restaurants, parties, podcasts, talk radio
- **Low (Right):** Eat in **complete silence or very soft sounds**—no music, no conversation, minimal ambient noise

**Why It Works:** The auditory system and digestive system are neurologically linked. Color 5 beings **process nutrients through sound waves**. The wrong acoustic frequency disrupts enzymatic function.

**Modern Challenge:** We rarely control the soundscape—restaurants blast music, open offices create noise pollution. Color 5 beings must **actively curate** their acoustic environment.

#### Shadows (High)
- **Noise Dependency:** Needing constant stimulation, unable to tolerate quiet
- **Overstimulation:** Eating in chaotic, overwhelming soundscapes that stress the nervous system

#### Shadows (Low)
- **Social Isolation:** Refusing to eat with others because "they're too loud"
- **Hypersensitivity:** Becoming irritated by the slightest sound, losing flexibility

#### Practical Tips (High)
- Play **upbeat music** while eating (rock, pop, jazz)
- Eat with talkative friends or in busy, noisy restaurants
- Listen to podcasts or audiobooks during meals
- Notice: Does sound increase enjoyment? Speed up digestion?

#### Practical Tips (Low)
- Eat in **silent rooms** with no background noise
- Use earplugs if eating in public spaces
- Communicate to companions: "I need quiet while eating"
- Notice: Does silence improve taste? Reduce digestive discomfort?

**Historical Parallel:** **Sufi dhikr (chanting) while eating** vs. **Zen Buddhist silent meals (oryoki)**.

### Color 6: Light (Direct/Indirect)

**Keyword:** Solar Timing

**The Principle:** Sensitivity to **the sun**. Direct beings eat only when the sun is up (daytime). Indirect beings eat only when the sun is down (nighttime) or "sleep on their food."

#### The Practice
- **Direct (Left - Day/Sun):** Eat only during **daylight hours**—breakfast through early dinner, ceasing before sunset
- **Indirect (Right - Night/Nocturnal):** Eat only during **darkness**—late dinner, midnight meals, or eat a large meal before bed and "sleep on it"

**Why It Works:** The circadian rhythm governs digestive enzyme production. Color 6 beings are **mechanically aligned to solar cycles**. Eating at the wrong time disrupts hormonal and metabolic function.

**Modern Challenge:** We eat on social schedules (lunch at noon, dinner at 7pm) without regard to sunlight. Color 6 beings must **defy convention** to align with the sun.

#### Shadows (Direct)
- **Rigidity:** Refusing to eat anything after sunset, creating social conflict
- **Nutritional Anxiety:** Worrying about "missing nutrients" by skipping evening meals

#### Shadows (Indirect)
- **Sleep Disruption:** Eating heavy meals late at night and waking unrested
- **Social Isolation:** Never joining breakfast or lunch gatherings

#### Practical Tips (Direct)
- Eat a large breakfast and lunch
- Finish dinner **before sunset** (or as the sun is setting)
- Notice: Does daytime eating improve energy? Reduce nighttime hunger?

#### Practical Tips (Indirect)
- Eat lightly (or not at all) during the day
- Have your main meal(s) **after sunset**
- Experiment with eating a large meal before bed and "sleeping on it"
- Notice: Does nighttime eating improve sleep quality? Morning clarity?

**Historical Parallel:** **Intermittent fasting (eating windows aligned with daylight)** vs. **nocturnal cultures (Mediterranean late dinners, shift workers)**.

## Determination and Brain Differentiation

### The Seven-Year Cycle

According to PHS teaching, correct dietary regimen produces **measurable brain differentiation** over a **seven-year cycle**.[^4]

**Why seven years?** The body fully regenerates its cells approximately every seven years. Consistent correct eating allows the brain to **reorganize its neural pathways** according to its original design (Design Crystal imprint).

**What changes:**
- **Sensory Acuity:** Taste, smell, touch, hearing, sight become more refined
- **Cognitive Clarity:** Mental fog lifts; decision-making sharpens
- **Immune Function:** The body defends itself more efficiently
- **Longevity:** Cellular aging slows; the vehicle is protected

**The Catch:** This requires **consistent practice**. Sporadic experimentation produces minimal results. The body needs sustained correctness to differentiate.

### The Relationship to Tone

Determination (Color level) is the **surface expression** of deeper **Tonal architecture**. Each Color corresponds to a specific Tone:

**Colors 1-2:** Splenic Binary (Tones 1-2) - Smell and Taste cognition
**Colors 3-4:** Ajna Binary (Tones 3-4) - Outer and Inner Vision cognition
**Colors 5-6:** Solar Plexus Binary (Tones 5-6) - Feeling and Touch cognition

**Implication:** Your Determination Color reveals which **sensory-cognitive system** your brain uses to process reality. A Color 1 being processes through **smell/taste**. A Color 5 being processes through **sound/feeling**.

**See:** [[Tone - Color - Base]] for full treatment of the substructure.

## Determination and the Other Variables

### Sequence: Determination First

Determination is the **gateway** to the other Variables.[^5] You cannot access [[Environment]], [[Perspective]], or [[Motivation]] correctly without first cleaning the internal system through correct dietary regimen.

**Why?** The brain is the processing unit. If the brain is clouded by incorrect fueling, it cannot perceive the correct Environment, hold the correct Perspective, or operate from true Motivation. Everything downstream depends on the upstream differentiation.

### The Unfolding

**Years 1-7:** Live by Strategy and [[Authority]]—decondition the mind, surrender to the body's intelligence

**Year 7+:** Begin experimenting with Determination—align dietary regimen to your Color

**Year 14+:** The body gravitates toward its correct [[Environment]]—you begin craving your correct physical surroundings

**Year 21+:** [[Perspective]] and [[Motivation]] stabilize naturally—the unique View and Drive emerge as byproducts

**No shortcuts.** Attempting to "be in the right Environment" or "see correctly" while still eating incorrectly is like trying to run a marathon without training. The body isn't ready.

---

## Practical Experimentation: Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**1. You must be living your Strategy and [[Authority]] consistently.** If you are still in the Not-Self mind, Determination experiments will only feed mental control.

**2. You must know your Determination Color.** This requires a full Human Design chart with **Tone/Color/Base** calculations (Advanced Imaging). Standard chart software does not show this—consult a PHS practitioner.

**3. You must approach this as **experiment**, not dogma.** PHS is about **testing and observing**, not rigid adherence.

### The Experimental Process

**Week 1-4: Baseline Observation**
- Eat normally (whatever you currently eat)
- Track: Energy levels, digestion quality, mental clarity, sleep quality, mood
- **Do not change anything yet**—just observe

**Week 5-8: Introduce Your Color**
- Begin practicing your Determination Color with **one meal per day** (e.g., breakfast)
- Example: If Color 1 (Appetite), eat breakfast consecutively—one food at a time
- Track the same metrics: Energy, digestion, clarity, sleep, mood
- **Notice differences** between baseline and practice

**Week 9-16: Expand Practice**
- Increase to **two meals per day** aligned with your Color
- Continue tracking
- Notice: Are benefits amplifying? Stabilizing? Plateauing?

**Month 5-7: Full Practice**
- Attempt to practice your Color with **all meals**
- This is challenging—social meals, travel, convenience all create obstacles
- **Do not be rigid**—aim for 80% consistency, not perfection
- Track long-term: How does sustained practice affect your baseline?

**Year 1+: Integration**
- Correct eating becomes **natural**—the body craves its correct regimen
- You no longer "try" to eat correctly—the body **rejects** incorrect circumstances
- Sensory acuity sharpens—taste, smell, texture become more refined
- Decision-making clarity increases—brain differentiation is occurring

## Shadows of Determination Practice

### 1. Orthorexia and Food Obsession

**The Danger:** PHS can become another form of **eating disorder**—obsessive control over every bite, moral judgments about "correct" vs. "incorrect" eating.

**Example:** A Color 1 being refusing to eat anything that isn't perfectly consecutive, creating anxiety and social isolation.

**Antidote:** Remember—PHS is an **invitation to experiment**, not a commandment. The body's intelligence is more important than perfect adherence.

### 2. Mental Override

**The Danger:** The Not-Self mind reading about Determination and **forcing** the body to comply, overriding somatic feedback.

**Example:** A Color 6 (Indirect) being forcing themselves to eat late at night even though their body signals exhaustion, because "the chart says I should."

**Antidote:** **Strategy and Authority override PHS.** If your Sacral says "no" to eating at night, honor that—even if you're Color 6 Indirect. The body knows.

### 3. Social Alienation

**The Danger:** Using PHS as an excuse to withdraw from communal eating, creating isolation and superiority.

**Example:** "I can't eat with you—I'm Color 4 Calm and your conversation is too loud."

**Antidote:** Relationships matter more than perfect regimen. Occasionally eating in "incorrect" circumstances to maintain connection is healthy. PHS is about **long-term patterns**, not every single meal.

### 4. Nutritional Reductionism

**The Danger:** Ignoring the **content** of food entirely, assuming that "correct circumstances" will compensate for poor nutrition.

**Example:** A Color 3 (Hot) being eating junk food because "as long as it's hot, it doesn't matter what it is."

**Antidote:** PHS describes **how** to eat, not **what** to eat. Quality still matters—whole foods, nutrient density, freshness. Correct circumstances **amplify** good nutrition; they don't replace it.

## Correspondences

### Ayurveda: Doshas and Agni

**Parallel:** Ayurveda's **Agni (digestive fire)** teaching emphasizes that digestion depends on **timing, temperature, and mental state**—remarkably similar to PHS.

**Difference:** Ayurveda categorizes people into three broad doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha). PHS offers **384 individualized configurations** (64 hexagrams × 6 colors).

### Traditional Chinese Medicine: Spleen Qi

**Parallel:** TCM teaches that **Spleen Qi** (digestive capacity) is strengthened by warm foods, regular meal timing, and calm eating—resonating with Color 3 (Thirst), Color 4 (Touch), and Color 6 (Light).

**Difference:** TCM prescribes based on constitutional patterns. PHS prescribes based on the **Design Crystal imprint** at birth.

### Jungian Psychology: The Body as Unconscious

**Parallel:** Jung recognized the **body as a carrier of unconscious intelligence**. PHS aligns—the Design Crystal (unconscious) determines dietary needs, not the Personality (conscious mind).

**Integration:** [[Anima et Algorithm]]—Determination is the **Anima's fuel source**. Correct eating differentiates the body, allowing the Anima (embodied knowing) to emerge clearly.

### The Window: House of the Land

**Parallel:** The [[The Astrolabe]]'s **House of the Land** governs **stability, foundation, and physical form**—resonating with Determination's role as the foundational Variable.
