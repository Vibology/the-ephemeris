# Right Angle Cross of the Maya (3)

## Gates: 32/42/62/61 | Quarter of Duality

### Ra's Keynote
> "Inner knowing and detail guide their ability to properly evaluate and inspire material development, maturation, and expansion."[^1]

## The Four Gates

### Personality Sun: Gate 32 - Duration (Continuity)
**Center:** Spleen | **Circuitry:** Tribal Ego

Gate 32 is **the instinct for what endures**—the splenic awareness that evaluates what has lasting value. As the Personality Sun, this defines the conscious purpose: to discern what is worth preserving, what will survive the test of time.

### Personality Earth: Gate 42 - Increase (Growth)
**Center:** Sacral | **Circuitry:** Collective Sensing

Gate 42 grounds the evaluation with **the energy to complete**. The discernment of value is backed by the capacity to bring cycles to their natural completion, allowing growth.

### Design Sun: Gate 62 - Preponderance of the Small (Details)
**Center:** Throat | **Circuitry:** Collective Logic

Gate 62 operates unconsciously as **precise articulation**. Beneath the conscious evaluation lies the capacity to name and detail, to give factual form to what is discerned.

### Design Earth: Gate 61 - Inner Truth (Mystery)
**Center:** Head | **Circuitry:** Individual Knowing

Gate 61 grounds articulation with **the pressure of inner truth**. The unconscious drive to know what cannot be fully known, inspiring the evaluation process.

## Cross Theme

The **RAX of the Maya (3)** in the Quarter of Duality carries the archetype of the **evaluating partner**—one who fulfills purpose through bonding by using inner knowing and detail to inspire material development.

This cross places splenic evaluation (32) at the helm, backed by completing energy (42), while unconsciously driven by articulated inner truth (62/61). The result is someone whose discernment of value guides bonding toward material expansion and maturation.

In the Quarter of Duality (Bonding), this Maya uses relational faculties to:
- Evaluate partnerships based on what will endure
- Guide material development through discernment of lasting value
- Unconsciously articulate the details of inner knowing
- Inspire expansion through completed cycles

Maya 3 knows which bonds will endure—and guides them toward growth through completing what has value.

## Quarter Context

**Quarter of Duality | Realm of Sun/Earth | Purpose through Bonding**

In the Quarter of Duality, the Maya (3) serves the bonding function of **material discernment**. Relationships require knowing what is worth investing in. This cross carries that evaluating instinct into partnership.

The question posed: "What makes a bond worth preserving?" The answer: the splenic knowing of what will endure, backed by the energy to complete the cycle.

---

## Shadow Expression

- **Paralytic evaluation:** So focused on determining value that no bond is ever formed
- **Completion anxiety:** Unable to finish because nothing seems worth completing
- **Detail obsession:** Unconsciously articulating so many details that the whole is lost
- **Truth pressure:** The drive of Gate 61 becoming existential anxiety about relationships
- **Materialism:** Evaluating bonds only by material development, losing the inner dimension

---

## Highest Expression

- **Value discerner:** Knowing instinctively which bonds will endure and grow
- **Material guide:** Inspiring expansion and maturation through completing presence
- **Truth articulator:** Unconsciously naming the inner knowing that guides evaluation
- **Partnership stabilizer:** Bringing the instinct for duration into relational development
- **The appraiser:** Seeing clearly what is worth preserving and what must be released
