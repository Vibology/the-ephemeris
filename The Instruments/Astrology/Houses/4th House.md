# 4th House
*Roots and the Foundation of Being*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **4th House** is the **Imum Coeli** (IC)—the lowest point in the chart, the hidden foundation. This is the house of **ancestry**, home, and the private self that exists before the world imposes its demands. It represents the father (traditionally), the land, and the emotional bedrock from which all growth emerges.

Where the 10th House (MC) is the peak visible to all, the 4th House is the **roots beneath the soil**—unseen but essential. Without roots, there can be no tree.

Lilly describes the 4th House as governing "fathers, lands, houses, inheritance, hidden treasure, tillage, and the conclusion or end of any matter."[^1]
