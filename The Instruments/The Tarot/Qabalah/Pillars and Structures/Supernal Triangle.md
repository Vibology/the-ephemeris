# Supernal Triangle
*The Three Supernals — Above the Abyss*

---

## Overview

The **Supernal Triangle** consists of the three highest Sephiroth on the [[The Tree of Life]], existing above [[The Abyss]] in a realm of pure divine unity. These three — [[Kether]], [[Chokmah]], and [[Binah]] — are not things that can be experienced through ordinary consciousness. They are the *conditions* of experience itself: existence, awareness, and form.

Where the seven lower Sephiroth (Chesed through Malkuth) represent the manifested world of qualities, relationships, and actions, the Supernals represent what *makes manifestation possible*. They are the creators, not the created — the source code before the program runs.

## The Three Supernals

| Sephirah | Name | Number | Function | Divine Name | Archangel |
|----------|------|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| [[Kether]] | Crown | 1 | Pure unity, "I Am," the dimensionless point | [[Eheieh]] (אהיה) | [[Metatron]] |
| [[Chokmah]] | Wisdom | 2 | Supernal Father (*Abba*), pure force, the seed | YHVH (יהוה) | [[Raziel]] |
| [[Binah]] | Understanding | 3 | Supernal Mother (*Imma*), pure form, the womb | Elohim (אלהים) | [[Tzaphkiel]] |

## The Point and the Palace

The Zohar's most frequent metaphor for the Supernal dynamics is the **Point** and the **Palace**. Chokmah is the "Primordial Point" (*nekudah rishonah*) — the first thing that can be called *something* rather than *nothing*. It is seed, stimulus, the flash of insight before comprehension.[^1]

Binah is the "Palace" (*heikhal*) that receives this point. She is the womb into which the seed of Chokmah is sown, the understanding that gives form to raw wisdom.[^2] Without Binah, Chokmah would remain a dimensionless flash — pure energy with no vessel. Without Chokmah, Binah would be an empty vessel with nothing to hold.

Between them they enact the fundamental polarity of the universe: **force and form**, **stimulus and response**, **the seed and the soil**.

### The River from Eden

The Zohar also describes the Supernal relationship through the metaphor of a river: "A river flows out of Eden to water the garden."[^3] Eden is Chokmah (the hidden garden of pure Wisdom); the river is the flowing of divine energy; and the garden watered below is the lower Tree. Binah is the great river itself — the channel through which undifferentiated force becomes differentiated form, through which the seven lower Sephiroth are "born."

## Supernal Father and Supernal Mother

The Zohar consistently names Chokmah as ***Abba*** (Father) and Binah as ***Imma*** (Mother).[^4] This is not gendered in the biological sense but in the metaphysical: Chokmah is the active, projective, fertilizing principle; Binah is the receptive, formative, gestating principle.

Their "union" — the Supernal *hieros gamos* — produces the seven lower Sephiroth. Binah "gives birth" to the lower Tree, beginning with [[Chesed]].[^5] This is why Binah is called the **Great Mother** and associated with Saturn: she is the boundary-maker, the one who imposes limitation on the limitless, and limitation is the beginning of all particular existence.

Kether presides above this dyad as the unity that precedes their differentiation — the "Crown" that rests above the head, the point of origin before the split into Father and Mother. In the Zohar, Kether is sometimes called the ***Attiqa Qaddisha*** (Holy Ancient One) or ***Reisha de-Lo Ityada*** (the Head That Is Not Known).[^6]

## The Abyss Below

The Supernal Triangle is separated from the seven lower Sephiroth by [[The Abyss]] — the ontological chasm that marks the transition from the ideal to the actual, from potential to manifestation. The Supernals are what *could be*; the lower Sephiroth are what *is*.

This divide is bridged by [[Daath]] (Knowledge), the invisible non-Sephirah that occupies the Abyss on the [[Middle Pillar]]. Daath is the "child" of Chokmah and Binah — their union produces Knowledge — but it is not a vessel in its own right. It is the *interface* between the Macrocosm (Supernals) and the Microcosm (lower Tree), the passage through which divine energy descends and human consciousness can (at great cost) ascend.[^7]

### Crossing the Abyss

To experience the Supernals directly requires **crossing the Abyss** — the dissolution of the ego, the surrender of individual identity, the death of everything the aspirant believes themselves to be. This is the mystical experience described across traditions as the ***unio mystica***, the **Dark Night of the Soul**, the **death before death**.

The Supernals cannot be *known* in the ordinary sense. They can only be *participated in* through the annihilation of the knower — the point where subject and object collapse into identity. This is why Kether's divine name is ***Eheieh*** ("I Am") — not "I am *this*" or "I am *that*," but the naked fact of being before any predication.

## The Three Triads

The Supernal Triangle is the first of three triadic structures on the Tree:

| Triad | Sephiroth | Function | Level |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Supernal** | Kether, Chokmah, Binah | Divine unity, force, form | Archetypal / Atziluth |
| **Ethical** | Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth | Mercy, severity, beauty | Creative / Briah |
| **Astral** | Netzach, Hod, Yesod | Desire, intellect, foundation | Formative / Yetzirah |

[[Malkuth]] stands alone as the fourth world (Assiah, the material). Each triad recapitulates the Supernal pattern at a lower octave: an expansive principle, a restrictive principle, and a harmonizing center. The entire Tree is a fractal of the original three.

## Jungian Parallels

The Supernal Triangle maps to the deepest structures of Jung's analytical psychology:

- **Kether** corresponds to the ***Self*** — the archetype of wholeness and totality, the center that is everywhere and the circumference that is nowhere. Like Kether, the Self cannot be directly experienced by the ego; it can only be inferred from its effects (synchronicities, numinous dreams, the organizing pattern behind [[Individuation Process|individuation]]).[^8]

- **Chokmah** corresponds to ***Logos*** — the ordering, discriminating, meaning-giving principle of consciousness. The flash of insight, the creative impulse, the moment when something formless becomes an idea.

- **Binah** corresponds to ***Eros*** — the relating, connecting, form-giving principle. Not eros in the narrow sexual sense but the capacity to hold, contain, and bring into relationship. The womb of psychic life.

The Abyss below the Supernals corresponds to the threshold between the ***personal unconscious*** and the ***collective unconscious*** — the boundary beyond which the ego cannot travel intact. To encounter the Supernal archetypes is to risk what Jung called ***inflation*** (ego identifying with the Self) or ***dissolution*** (ego overwhelmed by archetypal energy). The Qabalah's insistence on the Abyss as a genuine danger — not a metaphor but a psychological reality — mirrors Jung's warnings about the encounter with the numinous.[^9]

## Notes

[^1]: Zohar — Chokmah as the "Primordial Point" (*nekudah rishonah*), the first emergence of *something* from the Nothingness of Kether.

[^2]: Zohar — Binah as the "Palace" (*heikhal*) that receives the point of Chokmah, the womb giving form to the seed.

[^3]: Zohar, commentary on Genesis 2:10 — "A river flows out of Eden to water the garden," with Eden = Chokmah and the river = Binah's channeling of divine energy to the lower Sephiroth.

[^4]: Zohar — Chokmah as *Abba* (Father) and Binah as *Imma* (Mother), the Supernal parents whose union produces the seven lower Sephiroth.

[^5]: Zohar — Binah "gives birth" to the lower Tree. The seven Sephiroth from Chesed to Malkuth are sometimes called the "Seven Days of Creation."

[^6]: Zohar — Kether as *Attiqa Qaddisha* (Holy Ancient One) and *Reisha de-Lo Ityada* (the Head That Is Not Known).

[^7]: Wang, *The Qabalistic Tarot* — Daath as the interface between Macrocosm and Microcosm, the "child" of Chokmah and Binah that is not counted among the ten.

[^8]: Jung, CW 9ii (*Aion*) — The Self as "the archetype of wholeness and the regulating center of the psyche."

[^9]: Jung, CW 12 (*Psychology and Alchemy*) — Warnings about the ego's encounter with numinous archetypal content, the risk of inflation and dissolution.
