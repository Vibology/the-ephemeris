# Planetary Condition

## Archetypal Essence

Not every planet in a chart speaks with equal clarity. Two Saturns at the same degree of the same sign may live radically different lives — one disciplined and structurally sound, the other crushed beneath burdens it cannot bear. The difference is *condition*: the total environment in which a planet operates, encompassing its relationship to the [[Sun ☉|Sun]], its sect allegiance, the aspects it receives from [[Jupiter ♃|benefics]] and [[Mars ♂|malefics]], and the hospitality or hostility of its sign placement.

Where [[Aspects|essential dignity]] answers the question *"How well is this planet resourced?"*, planetary condition answers *"What is actually happening to this planet right now?"* A planet in domicile can still be combust, enclosed by malefics, and overcome by Saturn from the tenth sign — dignity gives it a title, but condition reveals whether it can exercise its authority[^1].

In Hellenistic practice, assessing planetary condition is the bridge between static chart anatomy (signs, houses, dignities) and dynamic chart interpretation — the difference between reading a map and understanding what the traveler actually experienced on the road.

## Solar Phase Conditions

The Sun's light is the fundamental dividing line. A planet's visibility — whether it can be *seen* rising or setting against the sky — determines its capacity to manifest its significations in the native's life. The Hellenistic astrologers treated this literally: what cannot be seen cannot act openly[^2].

### Under the Beams (*hupaugos*)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Distance from Sun | Within 15° (applying or separating) |
| Effect | Debilitated — hidden, weakened, secret |
| Sources | Porphyry, Rhetorius, Antiochus, Paul of Alexandria |

A planet within 15° of the Sun is overwhelmed by solar light and rendered invisible to the naked eye. Paul of Alexandria describes such planets as *adranēs* — "impotent" or "ineffectual."[^2] The planet's significations become hidden, secretive, or simply unable to manifest outwardly. A 7th house ruler under the beams may indicate a marriage that remains hidden or a partner who is absent; a 10th house ruler under the beams may describe career efforts that go unrecognized.

**The Chariot (*lampēnē*) — Mitigation:** A planet is *not* hindered by proximity to the Sun if it occupies its own domicile, exaltation, or bounds. Porphyry, Rhetorius, and Antiochus all attest to this exception: the planet is said to be "in its chariot," armored against the Sun's overwhelming light by the dignity of its own territory[^3]. A Venus under the beams but in Taurus or Libra retains her effectiveness — she is in her own house, regardless of the Sun's glare.

### Cazimi / In the Heart (*enkardios*)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Distance from Sun | Within 1° (Rhetorius) |
| Medieval refinement | Within 16' (Sahl ibn Bishr) |
| Effect | Strengthened — intensified, empowered |

The single exception to solar debility. When a planet draws so close to the Sun that it is effectively *in the Sun's heart*, it is not destroyed but transfigured. The cazimi planet gains extraordinary potency — its significations are amplified and purified by direct solar contact[^4].

Rhetorius specifies within 1° of the Sun's center. Later Medieval astrologers narrowed this to 16 minutes of arc, making it an exceedingly rare and precious condition. The Hellenistic 1° definition, while broader, still restricts cazimi to brief windows of a few hours.

### Combust (*kaustikos*)

Brennan notes that while the concept of burning exists in Hellenistic texts — Ptolemy discusses Mars being "burnt" (*kaustikos*) — the formal technical distinction between "combust" (within ~8°) and "under the beams" (within ~15°) belongs primarily to the Medieval tradition. In Hellenistic practice, the fundamental question is simpler: *can the planet be seen?* The 15° boundary of Under the Beams encompasses the entire zone of solar invisibility, with cazimi as the sole exception[^5].

For practical purposes in traditional work:

| Condition | Range | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Cazimi | Within 1° (Hellenistic) / 16' (Medieval) | Empowered |
| Combust | Within ~8° (Medieval distinction) | Severely weakened |
| Under the Beams | Within 15° | Weakened, hidden |
| Chariot | Under beams BUT in own domicile/exaltation/bounds | Mitigated |

## Bonification and Maltreatment

These paired concepts — reconstructed by Brennan from the lost definitions of Antiochus of Athens, preserved in the writings of Porphyry and Rhetorius — form the core of planetary condition assessment. They answer the question: *Is this planet being helped or harmed by its neighbors?*[^6]

### Bonification (*agathunō* — "to make good")

Bonification occurs when the benefic planets — [[Venus ♀|Venus]] and [[Jupiter ♃|Jupiter]] — intervene on behalf of another planet, stabilizing and supporting its ability to manifest its significations constructively.

**The Seven Conditions of Bonification:**

| # | Condition | Greek Term | Description |
|---|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Struck by a ray | — | Aspected by a benefic (any major aspect) |
| 2 | Enclosed | *emperischecis* | Surrounded by benefics — one preceding, one following |
| 3 | Engagement | *sunaphē* | Applying to a benefic within 3° |
| 4 | Adherence | *kollēsis* | Separating from a benefic within 3° |
| 5 | Trined | — | Receiving a trine from a benefic |
| 6 | Overcome | *kathuperterēsis* | Aspected by a benefic from a superior position (dexter) |
| 7 | Ruled | — | In the domicile or bounds of a well-situated benefic |

### Maltreatment (*kakōsis* — "ill-treatment")

Maltreatment occurs when the malefic planets — [[Mars ♂|Mars]] and [[Saturn ♄|Saturn]] — afflict another planet, corrupting or obstructing its significations.

**The Seven Conditions of Maltreatment:**

| # | Condition | Greek Term | Description |
|---|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Struck by a ray | — | Aspected by a malefic (any major aspect) |
| 2 | Enclosed / Besieged | *emperischecis* | Placed between two malefics |
| 3 | Engagement | *sunaphē* | Applying to a malefic within 3° |
| 4 | Adherence | *kollēsis* | Separating from a malefic within 3° |
| 5 | Opposed | — | Receiving an opposition from a malefic |
| 6 | Overcome | *kathuperterēsis* | Squared by a malefic from the tenth sign (dexter square) |
| 7 | Ruled | — | In the domicile or bounds of a poorly situated malefic |

### Overcoming (*kathuperterēsis*) — The Most Severe Condition

Overcoming is among the most important concepts in Hellenistic astrology for determining which planet dominates a relationship. A planet *overcomes* another when it occupies an earlier position in zodiacal order and casts a dexter aspect — looking *forward* through the signs[^7].

**Dexter vs. Sinister:**
- **Dexter ("right-hand"):** The planet earlier in zodiacal order, casting its aspect *forward*. Stronger, dominant, active. Saturn in Capricorn is dexter to Mars in Aries.
- **Sinister ("left-hand"):** The planet later in zodiacal order, casting its aspect *backward*. Weaker, passive, receptive.

The most severe form is **domination (*epidekateia*)** — when a malefic occupies the *tenth sign* relative to the victim (a dexter square). The image is of a wrestler pinning an opponent from above, or an authority figure exercising absolute power over a subordinate. If Saturn overcomes the Moon from the tenth sign, the body and emotions (Moon's significations) are under Saturn's dominion — restricted, burdened, disciplined without mercy[^8].

When a benefic overcomes, the same geometry becomes profoundly protective.

### Enclosure (*emperischecis*)

A planet enclosed between two malefics is besieged — hemmed in with no escape. Enclosure operates in two modes[^9]:

1. **Bodily:** The victim is physically between two planets in the same sign (e.g., a planet at 10° with Mars at 5° and Saturn at 15°).
2. **By rays:** The victim's sign is flanked by aspects from the enclosing planets.

Usually the victim is separating from one encloser and applying to the other — moving from one source of affliction directly into another. The enclosure is broken if a benefic casts a ray into the intervening space, intervening on the victim's behalf.

### Engagement and Adherence

These describe the 3° zone of intense interaction:

| Term | Greek | Direction | Range |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Engagement | *sunaphē* | Applying | Within 3° of exact aspect |
| Adherence | *kollēsis* | Separating | Within 3° of exact aspect |

The [[Moon ☽|Moon]] is an exception: her engagement range extends to 13° (approximately her daily motion), reflecting her speed through the zodiac[^10].

Beyond 3°, planets may still be "applying" within their broader moiety (orb), but the 3° range is the zone of concentrated influence — where bonification truly supports and maltreatment truly wounds.

### Counteraction (*antanalusis*) — Mitigating Maltreatment

Maltreatment is not always final. Brennan identifies three modes of counteraction[^11]:

1. **Mutual Reception / Domicile Exchange:** The most effective mitigation. When the maltreating malefic occupies the domicile or exaltation of the victim, a guest-host relationship is established. Saturn maltreating Venus is far less destructive if Saturn is in Libra — he is Venus's guest and therefore constrained by hospitality. The malefic may still cause difficulty, but it cannot entirely destroy what it owes allegiance to.

2. **Benefic Intervention:** If Jupiter or Venus cast a ray (especially trine or sextile) into the configuration, they can bonify the victim and neutralize the maltreatment. The benefic interposes itself as protector.

3. **Sect Mitigation:** Maltreatment is less severe when the malefic is of the same sect as the chart. Mars in a nocturnal chart is "on his own team" — his malice is tempered. Saturn in a diurnal chart exercises authority rather than cruelty.

## Sect and Hayz

### Sect (*hairesis*)

The diurnal/nocturnal division of planets is foundational to all condition assessment:

| Sect | Planets | Character |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Diurnal | [[Sun ☉\|Sun]], [[Jupiter ♃\|Jupiter]], [[Saturn ♄\|Saturn]] | Clarity, order, hierarchy |
| Nocturnal | [[Moon ☽\|Moon]], [[Venus ♀\|Venus]], [[Mars ♂\|Mars]] | Receptivity, desire, drive |
| Variable | [[Mercury ☿\|Mercury]] | Diurnal as morning star; nocturnal as evening star |

A benefic in sect (Jupiter by day, Venus by night) is *more* benefic. A malefic in sect (Saturn by day, Mars by night) is *less* malefic — its destructive tendencies are tempered by operating in its proper environment[^12].

### Rejoicing (*chairein*)

Beyond basic sect membership, a planet *rejoices* when additional conditions are met:

- **Hemisphere:** Diurnal planets rejoice above the earth by day, below by night. Nocturnal planets reverse.
- **Sign gender:** Diurnal planets rejoice in masculine (positive) signs. Nocturnal planets rejoice in feminine (negative) signs.

### Hayz — Complete Sect Satisfaction

| Condition | Diurnal Planet | Nocturnal Planet |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Chart sect | Day chart | Night chart |
| Hemisphere | Above the earth | Below the earth |
| Sign gender | Masculine sign | Feminine sign |

When all three conditions are satisfied simultaneously, the planet is in *hayz* — a state of extraordinary potency where it acts in its most constructive and powerful nature. The Arabic/Medieval tradition heavily emphasized this concept, but its roots lie in the Hellenistic rejoicing conditions[^13].

## Other Conditions

### Planetary Phase (Relative to the Sun)

| Phase | Position | Character |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Oriental / Matutine (Morning Star) | Rises before the Sun | Stronger, more active, "masculine" expression |
| Occidental / Vespertine (Evening Star) | Sets after the Sun | Weaker, more passive, slower to act |

Morning star planets operate with greater promptness and vigor. Evening star planets express their significations more gradually and receptively[^14].

### Spear-Bearing (*doryphory*)

A configuration of eminence: planets that attend the luminaries — rising before the Sun (matutine) or setting after the Moon (vespertine) — act as "bodyguards" or spear-bearers. Multiple planets in spear-bearing configuration around the luminaries in a natal chart traditionally indicate prominence, power, or distinction in the life[^15].

### Void of Course (*kenodromia*)

Antiochus and Porphyry define void of course as the Moon not applying to any planet by degree or bodily conjunction within the next 30° — "running in the void" without engagement, unable to bring matters to completion[^16]. This differs from the later Lilly/modern definition (no aspect before leaving the current sign), and the Hellenistic definition is considerably more restrictive.

## Psychological Depth

The condition system, read through Jungian depth, reveals something about the nature of psychic content under pressure. A planet is not merely a point in space — it is a complex, an archetype with its own developmental trajectory. The question of condition is the question of whether an archetype can *speak* in the life or whether it is suppressed, co-opted, or overwhelmed by other psychic forces.

**Bonification** mirrors what happens when the ego encounters supportive archetypal content — the [[The Anima]] or [[The Self|Self]] that strengthens rather than overwhelms. The benefics are not merely "good luck" but psychic allies: Venus bonifying Mars is desire teaching aggression the language of relationship; Jupiter bonifying Saturn is meaning tempering limitation with purpose.

**Maltreatment** is the archetype under siege — Saturn's depression crushing Venus's capacity for pleasure, Mars's aggression destabilizing the Moon's emotional security. The *enclosed* planet (besieged between two malefics) is the psychic content with no exit: anxiety that can neither discharge through action (Mars) nor find structure through patience (Saturn), but is trapped between them.

**Overcoming** reveals the hierarchy of psychic forces. The planet in the superior position is the dominant complex — what overrides, what takes precedence in the inner life. When Saturn overcomes the Sun from the tenth sign, the father complex or the inner critic holds authority over the conscious identity. When Jupiter overcomes, faith or meaning-making holds the dominant position.

**Counteraction** is the psychological equivalent of integration: the malefic that is received in mutual reception is the difficult content that belongs to the personality — the [[The Shadow]] that has been acknowledged and given a place in the house. It still causes difficulty, but it no longer destroys.

---

## Shadow Expression

Planetary condition taken literally, without psychological nuance, becomes fatalism — the assumption that a maltreated planet is simply "bad" and nothing can be done. This was precisely the trap Hellenistic astrology fell into in its most deterministic phases, and it is the trap modern psychological astrology rebelled against.

The shadow of condition assessment includes:

- **Reductive labeling:** Calling a combust planet "destroyed" without examining its chariot, reception, or sect. Every condition has mitigating factors.
- **Benefic inflation:** Assuming bonification means everything is fine. Jupiter's bonification can produce excess, entitlement, or over-expansion as readily as it produces generosity.
- **Malefic terror:** Reading maltreatment as pure catastrophe. Mars and Saturn are *necessary* — without them, there is no structure (Saturn) and no drive (Mars). Their maltreatment is often the pressure that forges.
- **Ignoring sect:** Judging Mars and Saturn identically in day and night charts. A nocturnal Mars is playing on home ground; a diurnal Mars is out of its element. The same planet, vastly different behavior.

## Interpretation Guide

### Assessment Protocol

When evaluating a planet's condition in a natal chart, proceed through these layers:

1. **Sect:** Is the planet in or out of sect? Is it a benefic or malefic in this chart's context?
2. **Solar phase:** Is the planet under the beams? If so, is it in its chariot?
3. **Essential dignity:** Does the planet have strength through domicile, exaltation, or bounds?
4. **Bonification:** Is the planet aspected, enclosed, or ruled by benefics?
5. **Maltreatment:** Is the planet aspected, enclosed, overcome, or ruled by malefics?
6. **Counteraction:** If maltreated, is there mutual reception, benefic intervention, or sect mitigation?
7. **Phase:** Is the planet oriental (morning star) or occidental (evening star)?

### Condition Summary Table

For quick reference during chart delineation:

| Favorable Conditions | Unfavorable Conditions |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| In sect | Contrary to sect |
| Cazimi (within 1°) | Under the beams (within 15°) |
| In chariot (own dignity) | No essential dignity |
| Bonified by benefics | Maltreated by malefics |
| Overcome by benefic | Overcome by malefic (esp. 10th sign) |
| Enclosed by benefics | Enclosed/besieged by malefics |
| In hayz (all sect conditions) | — |
| Oriental / morning star | Occidental / evening star |
| Counteracted (mutual reception) | Maltreatment without mitigation |

### Example

A Mars in Cancer (fall, no essential dignity) in a day chart (out of sect), under the beams (within 15° of Sun), overcome by Saturn from the tenth sign — this Mars is in extreme difficulty: no dignity, wrong sect, hidden, and dominated. But if Mars is in Jupiter's bounds and Jupiter casts a trine from a strong position, counteraction begins. Mars still struggles, but the struggle has purpose, and the outcome is not destruction.
