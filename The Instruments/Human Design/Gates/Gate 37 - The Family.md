# Gate 37: The Family (Friendship)

## Ra's Definition
According to Ra Uru Hu, Gate 37 is located in the Solar Plexus Center and represents **tribal friendship and bargaining**—the emotional foundation of family and community through reciprocal agreements. This is the gate that says "I feel connected to you through our mutual support and fair exchange."

Ra taught that Gate 37 operates within the **Tribal Ego Circuit**, which means it carries the energy of **support and resource exchange**—ensuring the tribe (family, business, community) survives through emotional bonding and reciprocal agreements. This is not individual empowerment or collective universality—this is tribal intimacy: "We take care of each other."

**"Gate 37 is the family. It's friendship through bargains—I'll do this for you, you do that for me. Without Gate 40, this friendship has no will to provide. It's just emotional attachment without action."** — Ra Uru Hu[^1]

The keynote here is **equality through exchange**—friendship is not one-sided dependence but mutual support, fair bargaining, emotional reciprocity.

## I-Ching Hexagram Analysis

Hexagram 37, **家人 (Jiā Rén) - The Family / The Clan**, is composed of Wind above (☴ Xun, the Gentle) over Fire below (☲ Li, the Clinging)—the image of the family hearth, warmth and light contained within the household, gentle guidance nurturing the flame.

**Judgment (Wilhelm/Baynes):**
> "The Family. The perseverance of the woman furthers."

The hexagram speaks to **family structure and roles**—the traditional household where each member has a function, where reciprocity creates stability, where emotional bonding is formalized through agreements (in traditional contexts, often gendered).

**Image:**
> "Wind comes forth from fire: The image of the Family. Thus the superior man has substance in his words and duration in his way of life."

This is the essence of Gate 37: **words must have substance (bargains must be honored), and life must have duration (relationships require sustained reciprocity)**. The family is maintained not by sentiment alone but by kept agreements.

In Human Design terms, this hexagram's placement in the **Solar Plexus Center** transforms philosophical family into **emotional tribal bonding**. The question becomes: "Who are my people, and what bargains maintain our connection?"

## Line-by-Line Breakdown

### Line 1: The Mother/Father
**Exalted (Venus):** Natural capacity to nurture and provide structure, creating emotional safety for the tribe.
**Detriment (Mars):** Domineering parental control, using authority to manipulate rather than support.

This line reveals the archetype: **Mother/Father**—the one who creates the family structure through emotional nurturing and provision. The shadow is confusing care with control.

### Line 2: Responsibility
**Exalted (Saturn):** Taking responsibility for one's role in tribal agreements, honoring commitments.
**Detriment (Neptune):** Avoiding responsibility, expecting others to carry burdens without reciprocity.

The second line names the foundation: **responsibility**. Gate 37's friendship requires each person to honor their part of the bargain. The gift is mature reciprocity; the shadow is freeloading.

### Line 3: Evenhandedness
**Exalted (Jupiter):** Fair distribution of resources and support, treating all tribe members equitably.
**Detriment (Venus):** Favoritism, unequal exchange, playing favorites within the family.

Line 3 is the trial-and-error foundation. This individual discovers through experiment that tribal bonds require **evenhandedness**—fairness in exchange, equality in support.

### Line 4: Leadership by Example
**Exalted (Sun):** Leading the family through modeling correct behavior, not through domination.
**Detriment (Uranus):** Expecting others to follow rules one doesn't honor oneself, hypocrisy.

The fourth line transpersonal shift: **leadership by example**. The individual learns that tribal authority is earned through integrity, not imposed through force.

### Line 5: Love
**Exalted (Mercury):** Genuine love and affection binding the family, emotional warmth supporting the structure.
**Detriment (Pluto):** Using "love" to manipulate, emotional blackmail, conditional affection.

Line 5 is the heretic/savior dynamic applied to family. The individual carries a projection—others expect them to love unconditionally. The gift is genuine affection; the shadow is love as transaction or control.

### Line 6: Purpose
**Exalted (Moon):** The family united by shared purpose, tribal bonds serving a higher goal.
**Detriment (Jupiter):** Family as an end in itself, insularity, no connection to larger purpose.

The sixth line culminates in **purpose**—the recognition that family/tribe is not just about survival or bonding, but about serving something beyond itself. After trials of lines 1-5, the individual knows family must have meaning.

## Circuitry Analysis

Gate 37 belongs to the **Tribal Ego Circuit**, one of two circuits within the broader Tribal stream (Ego and Defense). The Ego Circuit is characterized by:

- **Support and Resources:** Ensuring the tribe has material and emotional foundation
- **Bargains and Agreements:** Maintaining relationships through reciprocal exchange
- **Family and Community:** Creating intimacy through fair agreements
- **Material Foundation:** Building businesses, families, communities on sustainable resource bases

**The Role of Gate 37 in the Circuit:**

Gate 37 is the **emotional bonding of friendship**—the feeling of connection, belonging, and mutual care that motivates tribal agreements. This is the chemistry of "we are family," the emotional glue that makes reciprocity meaningful.

**Why Tribal Requires Bargains:**

The Tribal Circuit is not about universal love or individual freedom—it is about **ensuring specific people survive together**. Gate 37's friendship is based on agreements: if you support me, I'll support you. This is not cold transaction—it is **emotional reciprocity formalized**.

## Channel Formation

Gate 37 forms **Channel 37-40: Community** when connected to Gate 40 in the Heart/Ego Center.

#### Electromagnetic Function

- **Gate 37 (Solar Plexus):** "I feel friendship and connection; I want to bond through reciprocal support."
- **Gate 40 (Heart/Ego):** "I have the will to provide, to work, to fulfill my end of the bargain."
- **Channel 37-40:** The bridge between emotional friendship (Solar Plexus) and willful provision (Ego).

When this channel is defined, the individual has **consistent access to tribal community**—the capacity to create friendship through fair exchange, to bond emotionally and back it up with willful provision. This is the channel of the **community builder**—the one who creates family through reciprocal agreements.

**Without the channel defined** (only Gate 37 activated), the individual experiences **emotional desire for friendship** but may lack the will or capacity to provide/work in service of those bonds. They need someone with Gate 40 to complete the circuit.

#### Interpersonal Electromagnetic Dynamics

- **Both have Channel 37-40:** Mutual capacity for friendship and provision. Potential for strong tribal bonds or competing structures.
- **One has Gate 37, other has Gate 40:** The Gate 37 person provides emotional bonding; the Gate 40 person provides will to work. This is classic partnership.
- **Neither has this channel:** The friendship-provision dynamic remains latent.

## Biological and Somatic Dimension

Gate 37 is located in the **Solar Plexus Center**, which corresponds biologically to the **solar plexus/nerve plexus**. In the context of tribal bonding, Gate 37 is also associated with **oxytocin**—the bonding hormone released during intimacy, friendship, and family connection.

#### Physiological Signature

Individuals with Gate 37 defined may experience:
- **Emotional warmth and bonding chemistry** when in tribal relationships—the body feels connected
- **Emotional sensitivity** to fairness in relationships—inequality or broken bargains create distress
- **Nervous system activation** when tribal bonds are threatened (the nerve plexus responds to relational stress)

#### Energetic Signature

The Solar Plexus Center radiates **emotional wave** into the aura. When Gate 37 is active, the aura carries a frequency that says: "I want to belong. I want reciprocal friendship. Are we family?" Others may feel this as **warm**, **bonding**, or (if in Not-Self) **needy and demanding**.

**Defined vs. Undefined in Gate 37:**

- **Defined Gate 37:** Consistent desire for tribal friendship and reciprocal bonding. The individual knows they are here to create family through fair exchange.
- **Undefined/Open Gate 37:** Samples tribal bonding from others. Vulnerable to conditioning around "needing to belong" or "being part of a family." Can become wise about friendship by observing it in others without identifying with the need.

## Strategy Integration
Gate 37, being in the Solar Plexus Center, is linked to **Emotional Authority** when the Solar Plexus is defined.

**For those with Emotional Authority and Gate 37:**

Tribal friendships and agreements must be evaluated **through the emotional wave**. Do not commit to bargains in the peak or valley—wait for clarity over time. Friendship requires emotional truth, not impulsive bonding.

**For Generators/Manifesting Generators with Gate 37:**

The desire for friendship must still work with Sacral response. The Gate 37 energy says "I want to bond with this person/group," but the Sacral must respond to confirm whether *this particular tribal connection* is correct.

**For Projectors with Gate 37:**

The friendship wisdom is clear, but the Projector must wait for invitation before seeking to create tribal bonds. Uninvited attempts to join families or communities can lead to bitterness.

**For Manifestors with Gate 37:**

The desire for community can be initiated, but the Manifestor must **inform** before creating tribal structures or agreements.

**For Reflectors with Gate 37:**

The friendship need is inconsistent (activated by transits or others). The Reflector must wait the full lunar cycle before committing to tribal bonds or bargains.

## Not-Self Patterns
**Shadow Expressions of Gate 37:**

- **Weakness** (Gene Keys Shadow): Codependency, unable to exist without tribal approval or belonging.
- **Unequal Bargains:** Giving more than receiving (or vice versa), creating resentment.
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Using friendship to control, guilt-tripping through "family loyalty."
- **Favoritism:** Treating some tribe members better than others, creating division.
- **Freeloading:** Expecting support without reciprocity, breaking agreements.
- **Insular Tribalism:** Family as closed system, rejecting outsiders, no larger purpose.

#### Not-Self Indicators

- Feeling desperate to belong, joining families/communities out of need rather than correctness
- Tolerating unequal bargains because "family sticks together"
- Using emotional bonding to manipulate or control others
- Exhaustion from giving without receiving reciprocity

**Conditioning Patterns for Undefined Gate 37:**

Those without Gate 37 may be conditioned to believe:
- "I must belong to a family or community."
- "I need tribal bonding to have value."
- "If I'm not part of a group, I'm alone."

This conditioning leads to forcing tribal connections or tolerating unfair bargains to maintain belonging.

## Deconditioning Process

The **7-year deconditioning cycle** for Gate 37 involves learning to recognize when tribal bonding is authentic (correct reciprocal friendship) versus conditioned (codependent or unfair).

**Year 1-2:** Awareness phase—noticing when friendships feel reciprocal versus one-sided, when belonging serves versus depletes.

**Year 3-4:** Experimentation phase—trying different tribal structures (family, community, business partnerships) while observing which feel aligned.

**Year 5-6:** Refinement phase—honoring only fair bargains, releasing relationships where reciprocity is absent. Learning that equality is the foundation of friendship.

**Year 7:** Integration phase—bonding becomes **equality** (Gene Keys Gift) rather than weakness. The individual creates family through fair exchange, not neediness. Friendship becomes tender rather than transactional.

#### Somatic Practice

- Notice where the desire for belonging arises in the body. Is it the solar plexus (Gate 37)? The heart (ego/will)? Or absorbed from others?
- Practice **evaluating fairness in relationships**—are bargains reciprocal? Is support mutual?
- Release the need to "belong at any cost" and instead ask: "Is this tribal bond correct and fair?"

## Cross-System Synthesis

### I-Ching: Hexagram 37 - The Family

The I-Ching's Hexagram 37 represents **family structure and roles**—Wind over Fire, gentle guidance nurturing the hearth. In the Book of Changes, this hexagram counsels **perseverance in family responsibilities**, honoring roles and agreements.

In Human Design, this philosophical family is **transformed into tribal friendship**—emotional bonding formalized through reciprocal bargains.

### Gene Keys: Shadow → Gift → Siddhi

Richard Rudd's Gene Keys framework provides a shadow-gift-siddhi progression for Gate 37:

- **Shadow: Weakness** — Codependency, inability to exist without tribal approval, giving power away.
- **Gift: Equality** — Creating friendship through fair exchange, honoring reciprocity, mutual support.
- **Siddhi: Tenderness** — The recognition that all tribal bonding is the Divine caring for itself. Friendship becomes sacred.

The progression from Weakness to Tenderness is the journey of Gate 37: from codependency to fair friendship to sacred love.

### Astrology: Venus and Libra (If Applicable)

Gate 37 resonates with **Venus** (bonding, relationship, reciprocity) and **Libra** (fairness, balance, partnership).

### Qabalah: Chesed (Mercy) and Netzach (Victory)

Gate 37 resonates with **Chesed** (Mercy—benevolent structure, the merciful king) and **Netzach** (Victory—endurance, lasting relationship). Tribal bonding requires both mercy (forgiveness, support) and endurance (sustained reciprocity).

## Jungian and Psychological Dimension

In Jungian terms, Gate 37 corresponds to the **Family Archetype** and the psychological necessity of **belonging and reciprocity**.

**Archetypal Theme: The Family Member**

The Family Member seeks belonging through reciprocal care, creates bonds through fair exchange, maintains relationships through honored agreements.

#### Shadow Work Implications

The **Shadow of Gate 37** manifests as:
- **Codependency:** Inability to exist without tribal approval, giving identity away to the group.
- **Emotional Enmeshment:** Losing boundaries in family, confusing love with control.
- **Tribalism as Exclusion:** Creating "us vs. them," rejecting outsiders.

#### Individuation Path

For the individual with Gate 37, individuation requires:
1. **Separation from Codependency:** Recognizing that belonging does not require giving power away.
2. **Integration of Fairness:** Creating relationships based on equality, not obligation or manipulation.
3. **Sacred Tenderness:** Transforming friendship from transaction to tender care.

When integrated, Gate 37 becomes the expression of **Tenderness**—tribal bonding as sacred reciprocity.

## The Gift of Correctness

When the individual with Gate 37 operates according to their Strategy and Authority, the gift that emerges is **Equality** (Gene Keys) and **True Friendship** (Human Design).

#### What This Looks Like

- Bonding is **reciprocal**—fair exchange, mutual support.
- Friendship is **chosen**, not desperate—belonging based on correctness, not neediness.
- Bargains are **honored**—agreements maintained with integrity.
- The individual **knows their people**—recognizing true tribe versus conditioned connections.
- Weakness dissolves into **tenderness**—friendship becomes sacred care.

**The Signature of Gate 37:**

The Signature of the Solar Plexus Center is **emotional clarity over time**. For Gate 37 specifically, this manifests as:
- Knowing who belongs in the tribe through emotional truth
- Creating friendships based on fairness
- Experiencing belonging without losing self

#### The Contribution to Living One's Design

Gate 37 teaches that **friendship requires reciprocity**. When the individual honors emotional truth and creates fair bargains, they become a **living example** of equality and tenderness in relationship.
