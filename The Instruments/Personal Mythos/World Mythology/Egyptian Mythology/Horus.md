# Horus
*Behdety — The Falcon of Heaven, Divine Heir, and the Eye That Restores Order*

---

## Overview

**Horus** (Egyptian *Heru* or *Hor*, Greek Ὧρος) is the falcon-headed god of **kingship, the sky, solar power, and righteous vengeance** — the divine son who avenges his murdered father [[Osiris]], defeats the chaos of [[Set]], and ascends the throne as the legitimate king of Egypt. Every living pharaoh was Horus incarnate; every dead pharaoh became Osiris. This dual identification — the living king as Horus, the dead king as Osiris — is the **theological spine of Egyptian civilization**, encoding the principle that **legitimate authority passes from death to life, from father to son, from the underworld to the throne**.

Horus is one of the oldest and most complex Egyptian deities, with multiple forms that were conflated over millennia:
- **Horus the Elder** (*Haroeris*, Hor Wer) — the primeval sky god whose eyes are the sun (right) and moon (left), predating the Osiris myth
- **Horus the Child** (*Harpocrates*, Hor-pa-khered) — the vulnerable infant hidden in the marshes by [[Isis]], symbol of the divine child who must survive before he can rule
- **Horus of Edfu** (*Behdety*) — the winged sun disk, the falcon who defeats the enemies of [[Ra]]
- **Horus son of Isis** (*Harsiesis*) — the avenging son of the Osiris-Isis narrative

All these forms converge on a single archetype: **the force of order that emerges from chaos, the light that survives darkness, the heir who claims what is rightfully his**.

His sacred symbols:
- **The falcon** — supremacy of the sky, the eye that sees all, swiftness and precision
- **The Eye of Horus** (*Wedjat*) — the restored eye, healing, wholeness, mathematical perfection, protection
- **The winged sun disk** — solar sovereignty extended across the heavens
- **The double crown** (*Pschent*) — union of Upper and Lower Egypt, the two lands made one
- **The crook and flail** — inherited from Osiris, symbols of kingship (the shepherd and the thresher)

## The Sacred Narratives

### The Hidden Child

After [[Osiris]]'s murder by [[Set]], [[Isis]] conceived Horus with her resurrected husband and fled to the **papyrus marshes of Chemmis** (the Delta), where she raised the divine child in hiding.[^1] The infant Horus was constantly threatened: scorpions stung him, serpents attacked him, illness assailed him. Isis's magic and the protection of the marshes kept him alive. This period of concealment — the god-child hidden in the reeds, vulnerable yet destined for kingship — is one of the most resonant images in Egyptian religion.

**Archetypal reading:** The hidden child is [[The Divine Child]] archetype in its purest form: the new consciousness that is born from the death of the old order, that must be protected during its vulnerable phase before it can claim its power. The marshes (liminal, watery, between land and river) represent the **unconscious** — the hidden, protected space where new psychic content gestates before it is ready to enter consciousness. Every genuine transformation has a "marshes" phase: the period after the old identity has died and the new one is not yet strong enough to act.

### The Contendings of Horus and Set

The longest and most dramatic Egyptian myth is the **Contendings of Horus and Set** — a series of trials, battles, and divine judgments lasting eighty years, in which Horus and Set compete for the throne of Egypt. The conflict includes:

- **Physical combat** — Horus and Set fight in multiple forms; Set tears out Horus's **left eye**, and Horus tears off Set's **testicles**
- **Hippo contest** — Both transform into hippopotami and try to stay submerged; Isis intervenes
- **The tribunal of the gods** — [[Thoth]], [[Ra]], and other deities debate who should inherit Osiris's throne
- **The letter to Osiris** — Finally, the gods write to Osiris in the underworld, asking his judgment; Osiris threatens to send the demons of death to heaven if Horus is not given the throne

The resolution: **Horus wins the kingship of the living; Set is given the storms, the desert, and the borders of the cosmos** — he is not destroyed but **given a different domain**, assigned to defend Ra's solar barque against the serpent Apophis.

**Archetypal reading:** The eighty-year contest encodes the truth that **the struggle between order and chaos is never resolved through a single decisive act** — it is an ongoing, cyclical, multi-generational process. Horus's loss of his eye (the moon) and Set's loss of his testicles (generative power) represent **mutual wounding**: the encounter with the shadow costs both parties something essential. The final resolution — not destruction of Set but his **reassignment** — is psychologically profound: the shadow is not eliminated but integrated, given a legitimate function (boundary defense, storm-resistance) that channels its destructive energy toward the service of the whole.

### The Eye of Horus (*Wedjat*)

When Set tears out Horus's left eye and shatters it, [[Thoth]] gathers the pieces and **restores the eye to wholeness** — the *Wedjat*, one of the most powerful symbols in Egyptian religion. The restored eye represents **healing, mathematical completeness** (its parts correspond to fractions that sum to nearly 1, with Thoth supplying the missing fraction through magic), and the **return of sight after trauma**. Horus then offers the restored eye to [[Osiris]], who uses it to see in the underworld — the son's sacrifice becomes the father's salvation.

**Archetypal reading:** The damaged and restored eye is the archetype of **consciousness wounded by encounter with the shadow and then healed at a higher level**. Sight is lost through the conflict with chaos — understanding is damaged, the world becomes dark and fragmented — but Thoth (the principle of wisdom, writing, and measured thought) restores what was broken, and the new seeing is more complete than the original. The mathematical symbolism (the parts don't quite add up; the remainder is magic) encodes the truth that **rational analysis alone cannot restore wholeness** — something transcendent, something beyond calculation, must supply the missing piece.

## Jungian Analysis: The Divine Son and the Restoration of Order

### The Hero Archetype

Horus is one of the clearest mythological expressions of [[The Hero]] — the figure who must journey from vulnerability (the marshes) through ordeal (the contendings) to sovereignty (the throne). His hero pattern follows the classical structure: miraculous birth, hidden childhood, initiation through combat, wounding, and finally the achievement of what was promised.

In Neumann's framework (*The Origins and History of Consciousness*), Horus represents the **ego's emergence from the mother-unconscious** (Isis and the marshes) and its assertion of independent authority against the regressive, chaotic forces of the unconscious (Set). The hero must fight the "first father" (Set, the shadow-brother/uncle who occupies the father's throne) to claim the "true father's" legacy (Osiris's rightful kingship).

### The Son-Father Axis

The Horus-Osiris relationship encodes the **generational transmission of consciousness**: the father's death creates the conditions for the son's emergence, and the son's triumph redeems the father's sacrifice. This is not revenge but **restoration** — Horus does not merely punish Set but reinstates *maat* (cosmic order), and his first act as king is to offer his healed eye to Osiris, giving sight to the dead.

In Jungian terms, this is the **ego's relationship to the Self**: the ego (Horus) is born from the Self (Osiris) but must undergo its own development, its own combat with the shadow, before it can serve the Self consciously. The offering of the eye is the ego's gift of **conscious awareness** back to the totality of the psyche.

### The Wedjat and Individuation

The Eye of Horus, damaged and restored, is a symbol of **individuation** — the process by which the psyche, fragmented by encounters with the shadow and the unconscious, is gradually reassembled into a more complete whole. The fact that Thoth (the divine scribe, the principle of consciousness and naming) restores the eye connects this healing to the practice of **bringing unconscious content into awareness through articulation** — the therapeutic conversation, the alchemical work, the reflective practice that makes the invisible visible.

## Shadow Dynamics: The Righteous Avenger

### The Identification with Victory
Horus's shadow is the identification of the ego with **triumphant righteousness** — the stance that "I am the legitimate king, my cause is just, and therefore all my actions are justified." This creates a blind spot: the righteous avenger who cannot see his own capacity for the chaos he opposes.

### The Mother's Champion
Horus is so deeply identified with [[Isis]] that in one version of the Contendings, when Isis magically assists Set instead of him (to test him), Horus **cuts off his mother's head** in fury. This extreme reaction reveals the shadow of the divine child: the son who is so enmeshed with the mother that any perceived betrayal by her produces psychotic rage. The hero must eventually separate from the mother who protected him.

### The Perpetual Warrior
If Horus remains permanently identified with the combat against Set, he becomes the king who **cannot stop fighting** — the consciousness so focused on defeating the shadow that it cannot experience peace, rest, or the receptive qualities that Set's brother Osiris embodies.

### Integration Path
Horus integrates when he achieves what the myth depicts: not the destruction of Set but the **differentiation of domains** — order here, chaos there, each with its legitimate function. The mature Horus is the king who rules with the crook (gentleness) and the flail (rigor), who offers his healed sight to the underworld, and who can set down the weapons.

## Practical Application: Working with the Horus Archetype

### Recognition in Life
The Horus archetype is active when you:
- Feel called to **restore order** after a period of chaos or injustice
- Are emerging from a **protective, hidden phase** into visibility and authority
- Experience the need to **avenge or vindicate** something — a parent, a value, a principle that was wronged
- Are engaged in a **prolonged struggle** for legitimacy, recognition, or rightful position
- Feel a strong sense of **mission** — you know what you're meant to do, even if the path is long

### Working with Horus Consciously
1. **The Wedjat meditation** — Visualize the Eye of Horus, damaged and then restored. What part of your vision (your understanding, your perception) has been damaged by conflict? Ask Thoth to restore the missing piece.
2. **The falcon's perspective** — When caught in conflict, rise above. The falcon sees from height. Ask: What does this look like from the sky? What pattern is invisible from ground level?
3. **The crook and flail** — In any area where you exercise authority, check: Am I using the crook (gentle guidance) and the flail (firm discipline) in balance? Or am I relying on only one?
4. **The offering to the father** — What has your struggle taught you? Offer that insight to what came before — to the tradition, the lineage, the ancestors. Horus redeems Osiris by giving him sight.
