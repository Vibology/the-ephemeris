# To Inform: The Manifestor's Strategy

## Ra's Definition
**To Inform** is the [[Manifestor]]'s strategy for moving through the world without creating unnecessary resistance. It is not asking permission—it is **declaration**: announcing intention before initiating action so that others are not caught off guard by the Manifestor's independent impact.

The Manifestor is the only Type designed to initiate—to set things in motion without waiting for response, invitation, or lunar clarity.[^1] But this initiating power creates a problem: the Manifestor's closed and repelling aura naturally pushes others away, creating unconscious resistance.[^2] **Informing transforms this resistance into transparency.**

---

## The Mechanics: Declaration Before Action

The Manifestor's aura is **closed and repelling**—a protective field that shields their internal process from external interference. This is necessary for independent action, but it also means others cannot feel what the Manifestor is about to do. When action arrives without warning, it feels like control, invasion, or disregard.

### Why Informing Works

When the Manifestor informs before acting:
- **The aura becomes temporarily transparent** — Others can see intention and prepare
- **Resistance dissolves** — People feel included rather than blindsided
- **Impact amplifies** — Energy that would have been spent fighting resistance flows into creation
- **Peace emerges** — The Signature replaces the Not-Self Theme of anger

Informing is the Manifestor's recognition that **power without communication becomes tyranny, and autonomy without transparency becomes isolation.**

## The Practice of Informing

### What Informing Sounds Like

Informing is **declaration**, not request:
- "I'm going to start this project next week."
- "I'm leaving now."
- "I've decided to change careers."
- "I'm taking on this new direction."

### What Informing Is NOT

- **Asking permission:** "Can I...?" or "Is it okay if...?"
- **Seeking approval:** "What do you think about me doing...?"
- **Justifying:** "I need to do this because..."
- **Negotiating:** "Would it work for you if I...?"

The Manifestor informs to **eliminate resistance**, not to gain consensus. Others may have reactions, but informing is not an invitation to debate.

### Who to Inform

Inform anyone who will be **impacted** by the action:
- Partners, family members, close friends
- Colleagues, employees, collaborators
- Anyone who would otherwise be caught off guard

The question is not "Who needs to approve?" but **"Who will be affected?"**

---

## The Somatic Experience

Manifestors who practice informing experience:
- **Reduced friction** — Actions flow without unexpected obstacles
- **Internal peace** — The signature emerges naturally
- **Cleaner impact** — Initiations land without collateral damage
- **Sustainable autonomy** — Independence that doesn't isolate

The body knows when informing has been skipped. **Anger** arises—the Manifestor's Not-Self Theme[^5]—signaling that resistance is building from lack of transparency.

---

## Interaction with Authority

**Strategy** (To Inform) governs *how* the Manifestor engages with the world.
**Authority** governs *what* is correct to initiate.

The Manifestor's possible Authorities:
- **[[Emotional Authority]]** — Wait for clarity through the emotional wave before informing and initiating
- **[[Splenic Authority]]** — Inform and initiate in the moment when the Spleen says "now"
- **[[Ego Authority]]** — Inform and initiate what the heart/will is committed to

The sequence:
1. **Authority** reveals what is correct to initiate
2. **Informing** clears the path of resistance
3. **Initiation** sets the action in motion

Informing without Authority leads to initiating incorrect actions. Authority without informing leads to correct actions met with unnecessary resistance.

---

## Compatible Types

**To Inform** is exclusive to the **[[Manifestor]]** (~9% of the population).[^3]

No other Type has the closed aura that creates unconscious resistance, and no other Type is designed to initiate independently. Generators respond, Projectors wait for invitation, Reflectors wait a lunar cycle—only the Manifestor initiates, and only the Manifestor needs to inform.

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Forgetting to Inform

The Manifestor's independent nature often leads them to simply act without informing. This creates resistance they could have avoided—angry partners, confused colleagues, blindsided friends. The aftermath takes more energy than informing would have.

### 2. Asking Permission Instead of Informing

Conditioned Manifestors often learn to ask permission as children (when their initiating nature was punished).[^4] But asking permission is not the same as informing. Permission-seeking gives others veto power over the Manifestor's autonomy; informing simply makes the aura transparent.

### 3. Informing After the Fact

"By the way, I already did this" is not informing—it's damage control. Informing must happen **before** the action for the aura to become transparent. Retroactive informing doesn't eliminate resistance; it only explains it after the impact.

### 4. Over-Explaining or Justifying

Informing is a statement, not an argument. When the Manifestor starts explaining *why* they're doing something, they've slipped into seeking approval. The practice is: declare, then act. Explanations can come later if requested.

### 5. Informing Everyone About Everything

Not every action requires informing. Small daily choices don't need announcement. The question is: **Will this impact others?** If yes, inform. If no, simply act.

---

## The Gift of Informing

Manifestors who master informing bring:
- **Clean Impact** — Their initiations land without creating unnecessary conflict
- **Sustainable Power** — Independence that doesn't exhaust itself fighting resistance
- **Peaceful Presence** — The Signature emerges as the natural state
- **Effective Leadership** — Others follow because they feel included, not controlled
- **Model of Autonomy** — They demonstrate that independence and connection can coexist

---

## The Shadow of Not Informing

When the Manifestor abandons their strategy:
- **Anger builds** — The Not-Self Theme signals misalignment
- **Relationships strain** — Others feel controlled or disregarded
- **Resistance multiplies** — Every action meets friction
- **Isolation deepens** — The closed aura becomes a prison rather than protection
- **Power corrupts** — Initiation without transparency becomes domination

## Strategy Integration

### For Manifestors

1. **Inform before acting.** Make it a practice: before any significant action, ask "Who will be impacted?" and tell them.
2. **Declare, don't ask.** "I am doing this" rather than "Can I do this?"
3. **Keep it brief.** Informing is a statement, not a presentation.
4. **Don't wait for approval.** Others may have reactions; you're not asking them to agree.
5. **Notice when you forget.** Anger is the signal that you've created resistance you could have avoided.
6. **Forgive yourself for past un-informed actions.** The practice is ongoing; perfection is not the goal.

### For Those Around Manifestors

1. **Understand that informing is not asking.** When a Manifestor tells you what they're doing, they're including you, not requesting permission.
2. **Appreciate the transparency.** Informing is the Manifestor's gift to relationship—it costs them to remember, so receive it graciously.
3. **Don't demand justification.** The Manifestor doesn't owe you an explanation for their choices.
4. **Recognize the closed aura.** The Manifestor needs space; don't take their independence personally.
5. **Support their peace.** When the Manifestor is at peace, they're in alignment. When they're angry, something has created resistance.

---

*To Inform is the Manifestor's bridge between power and connection—the recognition that autonomous action need not mean isolation. When the Manifestor informs, they transform their closed aura into a window, allowing others to see what's coming and prepare. This is not weakness or compromise; it is wisdom: the understanding that impact without transparency creates enemies, while declaration before action creates allies. Peace is not the absence of power but its correct expression.*
