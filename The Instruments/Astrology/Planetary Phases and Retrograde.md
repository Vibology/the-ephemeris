# Planetary Phases and Retrograde

*The Dance of Visibility*

## Archetypal Essence

Every planet has two kinds of motion: its actual orbit around the Sun, and its *apparent* motion as seen from Earth. From the terrestrial perspective — the only perspective the natal chart records — planets accelerate, slow, halt, reverse, halt again, and resume forward motion in a repeating cycle called the **synodic cycle**. This cycle is not merely an optical illusion; it is the rhythm through which each planet's relationship to the Sun (and therefore to *visibility*) changes over time[^1].

The Hellenistic astrologers did not treat this cycle as secondary to sign placement or aspects. It was a primary condition: a planet's phase — whether it was rising as a morning star, hiding under the Sun's beams, standing still at a station, or walking backward through the zodiac — determined the *mode* of its operation. A planet's sign tells you *what* it signifies; its phase tells you *how* and *when* it delivers.

Retrograde motion — the planet's apparent backward walk — was not the psychological "review period" of modern astrology. In Hellenistic practice, retrograde was a condition of genuine debility: weakened capacity, delayed outcomes, and promises that may prove illusory. Understanding this tradition does not require abandoning nuance, but it does require taking the tradition seriously before softening it.

## The Synodic Cycle

The synodic cycle is the complete journey of a planet relative to the Sun, from one conjunction to the next. The cycle differs fundamentally between **superior planets** (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn — which orbit outside the Earth) and **inferior planets** (Mercury, Venus — which orbit between Earth and Sun)[^2].

### Superior Planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn)

The superior planet's synodic cycle unfolds as follows:

| Phase | Event | Condition |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1. **Conjunction** | Planet conjoins Sun | Invisible — hidden under the beams |
| 2. **Heliacal Rising** (*anatolē*) | Planet emerges from Sun's rays, visible before sunrise | **Morning star** — eastern, oriental, masculine |
| 3. **First Station** | Planet slows to a halt | Transition — preparing to retrograde |
| 4. **Retrograde** (*anapodismos*) | Planet appears to move backward | Debilitated — weakened, delayed |
| 5. **Acronychal Rising** | Planet opposes Sun — rises at sunset | Peak visibility — brightest, closest to Earth |
| 6. **Second Station** | Planet halts again | Transition — preparing to resume direct motion |
| 7. **Direct Motion** | Planet resumes forward motion | Restored — "activity, profits, enterprise" (Valens) |
| 8. **Heliacal Setting** (*dusis*) | Planet approaches Sun, disappears | **Evening star** — western, occidental, feminine |
| 9. **Under the Beams** | Within 15° of Sun | Invisible — cycle begins again |

### Inferior Planets (Mercury, Venus)

The inferior planets never oppose the Sun. Their cycle includes two conjunctions — one behind the Sun (superior conjunction) and one between Earth and Sun (inferior conjunction):

| Phase | Event | Condition |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1. **Superior Conjunction** | Planet behind Sun | Invisible — hidden |
| 2. **Heliacal Rising (Evening)** | Emerges east of Sun, visible after sunset | **Evening star** — occidental |
| 3. **Evening Station** (Venus) | Slows to halt | Transition to retrograde |
| 4. **Retrograde** | Appears to move backward | Debilitated |
| 5. **Inferior Conjunction** | Planet between Earth and Sun | Invisible — closest to Earth, mid-retrograde |
| 6. **Heliacal Rising (Morning)** | Emerges west of Sun, visible before sunrise | **Morning star** — oriental |
| 7. **Morning Station** (Venus) | Resumes direct motion | Restored |
| 8. **Direct Motion** | Forward through zodiac | Full strength returning |

**Mercury** is unique: he switches sect alignment with his phase. As morning star (rising before the Sun), Mercury is diurnal and masculine. As evening star (setting after the Sun), he is nocturnal and feminine. This makes Mercury the most phase-sensitive planet in the chart[^3].

## Visibility Conditions

### Under the Beams (*hupaugos*)

A planet within **15°** of the Sun (applying or separating) is *under the beams* — too close to the Sun's light to be visible. The planet is hidden, obscured, operating in secret. Its capacity to manifest outwardly is restricted[^4].

This is distinct from **combustion** (*sunodeuōn*), where the planet is within approximately **8°** of the Sun and its significations are severely damaged — burned up by solar proximity. And from **cazimi** (within **1°** or **16'**), where the planet is so close it is *within* the Sun's heart and paradoxically empowered. See [[Planetary Condition]] for the full solar phase assessment.

### Heliacal Rising (*anatolē*)

The moment a planet passes beyond 15° from the Sun and becomes visible again — emerging in the morning sky before sunrise. This is a moment of *birth* or *emergence*: the planet regains its capacity to act. Paulus Alexandrinus describes planets at heliacal rising as "exceedingly capable" — exercising special power[^5].

### Heliacal Setting (*dusis*)

The moment a planet moves within 15° of the Sun and disappears from view. The planet enters its period of invisibility, surrendering its capacity for outward manifestation.

---

## Morning Star and Evening Star

The distinction between **morning rising** (oriental, *heōia*) and **evening rising** (occidental, *hesperia*) is not merely astronomical — it modifies the planet's gender, timing, and mode of expression[^6].

| Phase | Position | Character | Timing |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Morning Star** | Rises before the Sun (oriental/eastern) | Masculine, active, assertive | Produces effects *earlier* in life |
| **Evening Star** | Sets after the Sun (occidental/western) | Feminine, passive, receptive | Produces effects *later* in life |

Valens specifies that morning-rising planets are *masculinized* in their expression — they act boldly, initiate, produce visible results. Evening-rising planets are *feminized* — they respond, receive, and operate through indirect channels[^7].

**For superior planets:** Morning star = strongest phase (moving away from Sun, gaining independence). Evening star = weakening phase (approaching Sun, losing visibility).

**For inferior planets:** The cycle reverses — Venus and Mercury alternate between morning and evening star across their shorter synodic cycles.

---

## Apparent Speed

Hellenistic astrologers tracked not just *direction* of motion but *speed* — whether a planet was moving faster or slower than its mean daily motion[^8].

| Speed | Greek Term | Condition | Signification |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Fast** (additive) | *prosthetikos* | Faster than mean daily motion | Produces effects *sooner* — swift manifestation |
| **Mean** | — | Average daily motion | Normal timing |
| **Slow** (subtractive) | *aphairetikos* | Slower than mean daily motion | Produces effects with *delay* — sluggish manifestation |
| **Stationary** | — | Approaching zero daily motion | Transition point — intensified, concentrated |

A planet's apparent speed changes continuously through its synodic cycle. It is fastest around conjunction with the Sun (direct, moving away from the Sun) and slowest near the stations (approaching or departing retrograde). Speed is a direct indicator of *when* the planet's promises will be fulfilled.

---

## Stations

### First Station (Stationing Retrograde)

The planet decelerates to a complete halt before reversing direction. In the chart, this marks the transition from forward-moving (direct, productive) to backward-moving (retrograde, debilitated). A planet at the first station is *about to lose its capacity for effective action* — it is at the threshold between strength and weakness.

### Second Station (Stationing Direct)

The planet halts at the end of its retrograde period before resuming forward motion. Valens considers this a moment of *restoration*: "activity, profits, and enterprise" resume after a period of delay and reversal. The second station is the threshold between weakness and recovery[^9].

A natal planet at a station is intensified — concentrated like a lens at its focal point. Whether this intensity is productive or obstructive depends on which station (first = entering debility; second = exiting debility) and the planet's overall condition.

---

## Retrograde Motion (*anapodismos*)

### The Hellenistic Assessment

The tradition is more severe than modern astrology typically acknowledges[^10]:

| Author | Term | Assessment |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Paulus Alexandrinus** | *adranes*, *apraktos* | "Impotent," "ineffectual," "insignificant" |
| **Vettius Valens** | *asthenes* | "Weakened," "hindered" — associated with delays, reversals, promises that are "only illusory" (*fantasias*), and hopes (*elpidas*) that may not materialize |

Retrograde literally means "walking backward" (*anapodismos*) or "retracing their steps" (*hupopodizontes*). The planet is revisiting territory it has already covered — it is not exploring new ground but retreating over old.

### Integration with Modern Practice

The Hellenistic assessment need not be taken as final pronouncement, but it should not be dismissed either. The tradition's insight is that retrograde motion reduces a planet's capacity for *outward manifestation*. Promises made under retrograde may be genuine in intention but delayed, reversed, or altered in delivery. This is not superstition — it is the observation that a planet moving backward through the zodiac does not operate with the same forward momentum as one moving direct.

Modern psychological astrology adds a valuable dimension: the retrograde planet turns inward, and what cannot manifest outwardly may deepen inwardly. But this deepening does not negate the traditional observation of *delay* and *reduced external effectiveness*. Both readings can coexist: the planet is weakened in worldly output precisely because its energy is redirected toward internal processing.

## Psychological Depth

The synodic cycle mirrors the rhythms of psychic energy as described by Jung — the ebb and flow between extraversion and introversion, between outward engagement and inward reflection.

**Heliacal rising** is the moment the unconscious content becomes conscious — the complex, the archetypal image, the emergent understanding that suddenly appears on the horizon of awareness. It is the beginning of a new psychological cycle: raw, energized, masculine in its assertiveness.

**Direct motion** is the ego's period of productive engagement with the archetype — the time of doing, building, acting on what has been perceived. The faster the planet, the more readily the psychic content translates into worldly action.

**First station** is the moment of hesitation — the sense that forward motion has exhausted itself and something must be reconsidered. In individuation terms, this is the ego's recognition that the current approach has reached its limit.

**Retrograde** is the descent — the return to what was passed over, the revisiting of unfinished psychic business. Valens's description of retrograde as producing "appearances" (*fantasias*) and "hopes" (*elpidas*) resonates with the Jungian understanding of inflation and projection: during retrograde periods, the ego may mistake its wishes for reality. What seems solid dissolves on closer inspection.

**Second station** is the turning point — the moment the descent completes and the psyche prepares to re-engage the world. The depression lifts; clarity returns; what was confused during the retrograde now has form.

**Heliacal setting** is the return to the unconscious — the content that was worked with sinks back below the threshold of awareness, not destroyed but integrated, available for the next cycle.

## Shadow Expression

- **"Retrograde is just a review period":** Reducing the entire synodic cycle to a single modern psychological interpretation. The tradition's assessment of genuine debility deserves serious consideration, not dismissal.
- **"Never sign contracts during Mercury retrograde":** The opposite error — treating retrograde as absolute prohibition rather than a condition that modifies timing and reliability. Retrograde weakens; it does not forbid.
- **Ignoring phase entirely:** Reading a chart by sign, house, and aspect without checking whether the planet is morning star, evening star, stationary, or retrograde. Phase is a primary condition, not an afterthought.
- **Speed neglect:** Treating all direct-motion planets as equal. A planet crawling toward its first station at 2' per day operates very differently from one racing at its maximum velocity.

## Interpretation Guide

### Assessing Planetary Phase in a Chart

1. **Determine direction** — Is the planet direct or retrograde?
2. **Check speed** — Faster or slower than mean daily motion? (Ephemeris or software comparison)
3. **Identify phase** — Morning star or evening star? Under the beams?
4. **Note stations** — Is the planet within 1-2° of a station? (Check dates in ephemeris)
5. **Synthesize** — Combine phase assessment with sign, house, aspects, and [[Planetary Condition]]

### Phase Condition Summary

| Condition | Strength | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Heliacal rising, fast, direct | **Strongest** | Maximum capacity for outward manifestation |
| Morning star, direct, mean speed | **Strong** | Masculine, active, earlier effects |
| Evening star, direct, mean speed | **Moderate** | Feminine, receptive, later effects |
| Slow, approaching station | **Weakening** | Decelerating — delay in manifestation |
| Stationary retrograde | **Transitional** | Concentrated but entering debility |
| Retrograde | **Debilitated** | Weakened, delayed, promises may be illusory |
| Stationary direct | **Transitional** | Concentrated, entering recovery |
| Under the beams | **Hidden** | Cannot manifest outwardly; operating in secret |
| Cazimi | **Paradoxically strong** | Within Sun's heart — see [[Planetary Condition]] |

### Integration with the Reading Sequence

Planetary phase belongs within the [[Planetary Condition]] assessment — specifically the solar phase evaluation:

1. Sect → 2. Chart Ruler → 3. Luminaries → 4. **Planetary Condition** (includes phase) → 5. Dignities & [[Triplicity Rulers]] → 6. [[Lots]] → 7. Timing
