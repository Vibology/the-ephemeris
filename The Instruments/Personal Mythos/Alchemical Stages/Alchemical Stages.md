# The Alchemical Stages
*Two Systems, One Opus*

---

## Overview

The alchemical tradition describes transformation through two distinct but interlocking classification systems:

**The Four Colors (*Colores*)** describe what happens to the matter — the observable phenomenology of transformation.[^1] These are the macro stages of the *opus*, the chapters of the work. Jung adopted this framework directly (CW 12, CW 14), and it forms his primary alchemical model for [[Individuation Process|individuation]].

**The Seven Operations (*Operationes*)** describe what the alchemist does to the matter — the procedural techniques applied at each stage. Jung referenced individual operations throughout his work (*calcinatio*, *solutio*, *coagulatio*) but never systematized them into a single sequence. The seven-operation model was codified by later scholars, particularly Edward Edinger (*Anatomy of the Psyche*) and Dennis William Hauck (*The Emerald Tablet*).

The relationship between them is **nesting, not parallel**: operations occur *within* color stages. The colors are the chapters; the operations are the work performed in each chapter.

## The Nesting Map

| Color (Macro Stage) | Operations (Within) | Element | Psychological Movement |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------|----------------------|
| **[[Nigredo]]** (Blackening) | [[Calcination]] (Fire) + [[Dissolution]] (Water) | Earth/Lead | Destruction of the old form — burning away ego defenses, then dissolving what remains into *massa confusa* |
| **[[Albedo]]** (Whitening) | [[Separation]] (Air) + [[Distillation]] (Water) | Silver/Moon | Purification — discriminating contents of the unconscious, then refining through repeated cycles |
| **[[Citrinitas]]** (Yellowing) | [[Conjunction]] (Earth) + [[Fermentation]] (Fire/Air) | Gold/Sun dawning | Awakening — uniting purified opposites, then quickening the result with living spirit |
| **[[Rubedo]]** (Reddening) | [[Coagulation]] (Earth/Fire) | Gold/Philosopher's Stone | Embodiment — fixing spirit into matter, the Self realized in lived experience |

## The Colors (Macro Stages)

The four *colores* represent the visible transformation of the *prima materia* through the *opus*. Jung sometimes reduced these to three (omitting Citrinitas, which even classical alchemists frequently skipped). The full sequence:

1. **[[Nigredo]]** — The Blackening. Death, putrefaction, confrontation with [[The Shadow|shadow]]. The necessary destruction that initiates all transformation. *"No Nigredo, no Albedo."*

2. **[[Albedo]]** — The Whitening. Purification, lunar consciousness, encounter with [[The Anima|anima]]/[[The Animus|animus]]. Recovery of vision after blindness — not escape from matter but clarity within it.

3. **[[Citrinitas]]** — The Yellowing. The most overlooked stage. Transition from lunar (Albedo) to solar (Rubedo) consciousness. The dawning of gold — not yet noon, but the first warmth. The [[The Wise Old Man|Wise Old Man/Woman]] emerges.

4. **[[Rubedo]]** — The Reddening. Completion. The *hieros gamos* (sacred marriage) of opposites. Spirit fixed into matter. The Philosopher's Stone as a way of being, not an achievement. [[The Self]] realized.

## The Operations (Procedural Techniques)

The seven *operationes* describe the alchemist's interventions — what is *done* to the matter at each stage. Each operation has its own element, psychological meaning, and archetypal signature:

### Within Nigredo
1. **[[Calcination]]** (*Calcinatio*) — Fire reduces the *prima materia* to ash. Psychologically: ego death, persona breakdown, the burning away of false structures.
2. **[[Dissolution]]** (*Solutio*) — Water dissolves the ash into solution. Psychologically: flooding by the unconscious, regression, emotional overwhelm.

### Within Albedo
3. **[[Separation]]** (*Separatio*) — Air discriminates the dissolved contents. Psychologically: discerning shadow from self, projection withdrawal, analytical clarity.
4. **[[Distillation]]** (*Distillatio*) — Repeated purification through evaporation and condensation. Psychologically: refining understanding, removing remaining impurities, spiritual clarity.

### Within Citrinitas
5. **[[Conjunction]]** (*Coniunctio*) — Union of the purified opposites. Psychologically: anima/animus integration, the marriage of conscious and unconscious.
6. **[[Fermentation]]** (*Fermentatio*) — Living spirit enters the united matter, quickening it. Psychologically: inspiration, creative breakthrough, the gold begins to glow.

### Within Rubedo
7. **[[Coagulation]]** (*Coagulatio*) — Spirit is fixed into matter permanently. Psychologically: embodied wisdom, the Self lived in the world, individuation made real.

## Source Distinction

It matters where each framework comes from, because the Library aims for traceable claims:

**Jung's primary framework** is the four colors. CW 12 (*Psychology and Alchemy*) and CW 14 (*Mysterium Coniunctionis*) work extensively with Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo. Citrinitas appears but is acknowledged as often omitted.

**Jung references individual operations** — *calcinatio*, *solutio*, *separatio*, *coniunctio*, *coagulatio* — throughout CW 12 and CW 14, but treats them as aspects of the process rather than a fixed sequence.

**The seven-operation sequence as a system** was codified by:
- **Edward Edinger**, *Anatomy of the Psyche* (1985) — maps seven operations to Jungian psychological processes
- **Dennis William Hauck**, *The Emerald Tablet* (1999) — synthesizes laboratory and spiritual alchemy into the seven-step model
- **von Franz** references operations but does not systematize them into seven

The nesting map above (which operations belong to which color) is a **Vibology synthesis** — consistent with Jung's descriptions but not found as a single table in any one source.
