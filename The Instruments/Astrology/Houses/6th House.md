# 6th House
*Service and the Sacred in the Mundane*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **6th House** governs **daily work**—not vocation (10th House), but the unglamorous labor of maintenance. This is the house of health, routines, service, and the discipline of showing up when inspiration has fled. It is **Virgo's domain**: refinement through repetition, the sacred found in the smallest details.

Where the 5th House is play and creative joy, the 6th House is **labor**—the work that sustains life but does not announce itself. It is the house of servants, employees, pets, and the body's demands for care. The 6th House does not seek recognition; it seeks **precision**.

Lilly describes the 6th House as governing "servants, day-laborers, sickness, its cause and curability, small cattle (hogs, sheep, goats), and uncles."[^1]
