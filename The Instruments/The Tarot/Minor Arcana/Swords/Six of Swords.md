# Six of Swords

*Lord of Earned Success*

---

## Traditional Symbolism

According to Waite's *Pictorial Key to the Tarot*, the Six of Swords signifies **journey by water, route, way, envoy, commissionary, expedient**.[^1] Waite describes the scene as a ferryman carrying passengers to the farther shore, and notes that "the course is smooth." When the Six of Swords appears upright, it speaks to the realm of successful transition—the journey from difficulty toward something better, the passage that carries you away from strife toward calmer waters.

The Golden Dawn titles this card the **"Lord of Earned Success"**[^2] and attributes it to **Mercury in Aquarius**—the planet of communication, travel, and intellect operating through the sign of detachment, vision, and the future. This is success that is *earned* through mental effort, through strategic thinking, through the wisdom to know when to leave. Mercury provides the guide; Aquarius provides the perspective that makes leaving possible.

Qabalistically, this is **Tiphareth in Yetzirah**—Beauty (the sixth Sephirah, the harmonizing center, the heart of the Tree) expressing through the Formative World of Air and intellect.[^4] Tiphareth is the place where all opposites are reconciled, where the competing forces of the Tree find balance. In the mental realm, this manifests as *intellectual harmony*—the mind that has found its way through conflict to resolution.

The card represents the **wisdom of transition**—the recognition that some situations cannot be improved, only left behind. The Six of Swords is not victory in the sense of conquering an opponent; it is victory in the sense of *surviving* and *moving forward*.

In readings, the Six of Swords is generally welcome—though its welcome is bittersweet. It indicates that you are leaving something behind, which may bring grief even as it brings relief. The journey is underway. The difficult situation is receding. Calmer waters lie ahead.

When the Six of Swords appears **reversed**, Waite identifies meanings of **declaration, confession, publicity; also a proposal, love declaration**.[^3] These seem unrelated to the upright meanings, but the reversal often indicates a blocked or complicated passage—the journey that does not go smoothly, the escape that is discovered, the transition that is resisted.

The key teaching: **Sometimes the only way forward is away**. The Six of Swords honors the wisdom of leaving, the courage of transition, the faith required to be ferried toward an unknown shore.

## Esoteric Interpretation

### The Sephirotic Lens: Tiphareth in Yetzirah

**Tiphareth** is the sixth Sephirah, titled **Beauty** (*Tiphareth* in Hebrew). It represents the harmonizing center of the Tree of Life, the heart, the place where the forces of severity and mercy, expansion and limitation, are balanced and reconciled.

In the Qabalistic framework, Tiphareth represents:
- **The Son**: The principle that mediates between Father (Chokmah) and Mother (Binah)
- **The Sun**: The center of the solar system, source of light and life
- **Beauty**: Not mere aesthetics, but the beauty of harmony, of all things in right relationship
- **The number Six**: The hexagram, the Star of David, the balance of opposites
- **Gold and Yellow**: The colors of solar radiance

The number **Six** represents harmony—the number of completion in the first half of the decimal system, the number of the hexagon (nature's most efficient shape), the number of balance. All Sixes in the Tarot carry this energy of resolution, beauty, and harmonious completion.

The Six of Swords is **Tiphareth-as-Air**—Beauty expressing through the mental realm. After the defeat and dishonor of the Five, Tiphareth offers *resolution*. Not the truce of the Two (which was merely suspended conflict), but actual harmony—the conflict is over, and what remains is the journey forward.

Tiphareth in Yetzirah teaches: **After struggle comes balance**. The mind that has survived conflict can find its way to peace. The Six of Swords is that peace—not the peace of never having fought, but the peace of having fought and survived and moved on.

### The Planetary Attribution: Mercury in Aquarius

**Mercury in Aquarius** combines the communicative, mobile nature of Mercury with Aquarius's capacity for detachment, vision, and future-orientation.

**Mercury** represents:
- **Communication**: The exchange of ideas, messages, information
- **Travel**: Movement from place to place, especially short journeys
- **The Guide**: Hermes, the psychopomp, the one who leads souls
- **Intellect**: Quick thinking, analysis, the rational mind
- **Commerce**: Exchange, trade, the movement of goods and ideas

**Aquarius** represents:
- **Detachment**: The capacity to step back and see from a distance
- **Vision**: Seeing the future, understanding patterns, systemic thinking
- **The Collective**: Humanity as a whole, the group rather than the individual
- **Innovation**: New ideas, unconventional approaches, breaking from tradition
- **Air**: The mental, analytical, conceptual element

**Mercury in Aquarius** produces a situation characterized by:
- **Objective perspective**: The ability to see the situation clearly, without emotional distortion
- **Strategic thinking**: Planning the route, calculating the passage
- **Innovative solutions**: Finding a way that others might not see
- **Communication of vision**: Sharing insights about the future
- **Guided transition**: The helper who knows the way

In the Six of Swords, Mercury in Aquarius manifests as **the guide who ferries you across**. Mercury is the boatman—the one who knows the waters, who can navigate the passage. Aquarius provides the detachment necessary to leave, the vision of the far shore, the understanding that staying would only perpetuate suffering.

### The Rider-Waite Symbolism: A Deep Dive

The Rider-Waite image of the Six of Swords is one of the most evocative scenes in the Minor Arcana—a moment of transition captured in stillness. Let us examine each element:

#### The Ferryman

At the back of the boat, a cloaked figure stands with a long pole, pushing the boat across the water. This is the **ferryman**—the guide, the psychopomp, the one who knows the way.

The **ferryman** represents:
- **Mercury**: The god who guides souls, the messenger between worlds
- **The therapist or guide**: One who helps others navigate transitions
- **The higher Self**: The part of the psyche that knows the way forward
- **Charon**: The boatman of Greek myth who ferries souls across the Styx

The **standing posture** signifies:
- **Vigilance**: The ferryman is alert, navigating
- **Labor**: Someone must do the work of crossing; the passengers rest while the ferryman works
- **Perspective**: Standing, he can see further than those seated

The **cloak** suggests:
- **Mystery**: The ferryman's identity is obscured; he is function more than person
- **Protection**: The cloak shields against the elements
- **Anonymity**: The guide does not call attention to himself

#### The Passengers

Seated in the boat, often depicted as a **woman and child**, the passengers are being carried across. They do not pole the boat; they are transported.

The **passengers** represent:
- **The querent**: The one in transition
- **The vulnerable parts of the psyche**: The inner child, the feminine soul
- **Those who must be protected**: The innocent who cannot ferry themselves
- **The ego in surrender**: The part that has relinquished control and allowed itself to be carried

The **seated, huddled posture** suggests:
- **Grief**: They may be mourning what they leave behind
- **Surrender**: They have given up control of the journey
- **Trust**: They trust the ferryman to carry them safely
- **Vulnerability**: They are exposed, dependent, in the liminal space

The **woman and child** specifically suggest:
- **The future and the past**: The child represents what is carried forward; the woman represents what has been experienced
- **Anima and Divine Child**: In Jungian terms, the feminine soul and the nascent Self
- **Refugees**: Those fleeing difficulty, seeking sanctuary

#### The Six Swords

Six swords stand **upright** in the boat, planted in the bottom like a small forest of blades.

The **six swords** represent:
- **The past conflicts**: The battles that were fought, the struggles that were endured
- **Lessons carried forward**: The wisdom gained through difficulty
- **Mental patterns**: The thoughts, beliefs, and structures of the mind
- **Baggage**: What cannot be left behind—the swords travel with the passengers

The **upright position** signifies:
- **Stability**: The swords are planted, not being wielded
- **Transformation**: What were weapons are now markers, standing like monuments
- **The vertical axis**: Connecting heaven and earth, spirit and matter
- **Non-violence**: The swords point up, not at anyone

The **placement in the boat** suggests:
- **Integration**: The conflicts have been integrated, not abandoned
- **Memory**: The swords remember; they are carried as witnesses
- **Weight**: The boat carries weight; the passage is not without burden

#### The Water

The boat crosses water—and the water is depicted differently behind and ahead.

The **water behind** (often choppy, turbulent):
- **The past**: What is being left behind
- **Turbulence**: The conflict, difficulty, or suffering of the previous situation
- **Emotion**: The troubled feelings associated with what was

The **water ahead** (often calm, smooth):
- **The future**: What lies ahead
- **Peace**: The calmer waters that await
- **Hope**: The promise that the passage leads somewhere better

The **crossing** itself represents:
- **Liminality**: The threshold space, neither here nor there
- **Transition**: The active process of moving from one state to another
- **The river of life**: The flow that carries all things forward

#### The Distant Shore

In the background, land is visible—the destination toward which the boat moves.

The **far shore** represents:
- **The goal**: Where the journey leads
- **The future**: What awaits after the passage
- **Safety**: Solid ground after the uncertain waters
- **The unknown**: A new place, not yet experienced

### Esoteric and Cross-Tradition Parallels

The Six of Swords resonates across multiple wisdom traditions:

#### Charon and the River Styx

In Greek mythology, **Charon** is the ferryman who carries souls of the deceased across the river **Styx** to the underworld. The dead must pay a coin (the obol) for passage; those who cannot pay must wander the shores for a hundred years.

The Six of Swords directly evokes this myth. The ferryman is Charon; the passengers are souls in transition; the water is the boundary between worlds. The passage is not free—the swords in the boat are the price paid, the struggles endured that have earned the right to cross.

But unlike Charon's passengers, those in the Six of Swords are not dead. They are crossing from one life situation to another, from one psychological state to another. This is the underworld journey undertaken while still alive—the initiatory descent and return.

#### The Exodus: Crossing the Sea

In the Hebrew Bible, the **Exodus** from Egypt culminates in the crossing of the Red Sea—the Israelites fleeing slavery, passing through the parted waters, leaving behind their oppressors.

The Six of Swords carries this Exodus energy. The passengers are leaving behind a difficult situation (Egypt, slavery, conflict), passing through water (the liminal passage), and heading toward a promised land (freedom, peace, the far shore). The passage requires faith—the Israelites had to walk into the sea believing it would hold.

#### The I Ching Hexagram 59: Dispersion (Huan)

In the *I Ching*, **Hexagram 59** (渙 *Huan*, "Dispersion/Dissolution") represents the dispersal of what has become stagnant or blocked.

The *Judgment* says: "Dispersion. Success. The king approaches his temple. It furthers one to cross the great water. Perseverance furthers."

This hexagram teaches that sometimes what has accumulated must be *dispersed*—the ice must melt, the blockage must clear, the stagnant must be stirred into motion. The Six of Swords is this dispersion: leaving behind what has become stuck, crossing the great water toward new life.

The phrase "the king approaches his temple" suggests the return to center—the journey of the Six is not wandering but purposeful movement toward the sacred.

#### The Night Sea Journey

In Jungian thought, the **night sea journey** (*nekyia*) is the mythic descent into the unconscious—the hero swallowed by the whale (Jonah), the sun god traveling through the underworld at night, the soul's journey through death and rebirth.

The Six of Swords is the night sea journey in its most hopeful form. The descent has been made; the unconscious has been faced; now the boat is crossing toward dawn. The journey is not over—they have not yet arrived—but the direction is correct, and calmer waters lie ahead.

### Psychological and Jungian Depth

In Jungian psychology, the Six of Swords represents the **ego in successful transition**—the conscious mind that has navigated a crisis and is now being carried toward integration.

#### The Liminal Passage

The Six of Swords depicts **liminality**—the threshold state between what was and what will be. In rites of passage, the liminal phase is the dangerous, transformative middle: no longer the old identity, not yet the new one.

The passengers in the boat are liminal beings. They have left the shore of their previous life but have not yet arrived at the new one. They are betwixt and between, neither here nor there. This is uncomfortable—but it is also the space where transformation occurs.

The Six of Swords teaches that liminality cannot be rushed. The boat takes time to cross. The passengers must trust the ferryman and allow the passage to unfold at its own pace.

#### The Guide Figure

The ferryman is a **guide figure**—what Jung would call a psychopomp, a guide of souls. In analysis, the therapist often serves this function: holding space for the patient's transition, providing the stable presence that makes the crossing possible.

The Six of Swords reminds us that some crossings cannot be made alone. The passengers do not pole their own boat. They require help—a guide who knows the waters, who can navigate the passage. To accept help is not weakness; it is wisdom.

#### Earned Success

The Golden Dawn title, "Lord of Earned Success," emphasizes that this passage is not given freely—it is *earned*. The passengers have paid for their crossing with the struggles represented by the swords. They have fought, suffered, and survived. Now they have earned the right to leave.

This is important psychological wisdom: you cannot skip the struggle and proceed directly to resolution. The Six of Swords comes *after* the Five (defeat) for a reason. The passage is earned through the ordeal; the calm waters are reached only by crossing from the turbulent ones.

#### Shadow Expressions of the Six of Swords

When unconscious or misapplied, the Six of Swords manifests problematically:

- **Running away**: Using "moving on" as avoidance. Leaving before the work is complete, before the lessons are learned, fleeing from difficulty rather than resolving it.
- **Carrying weapons into peace**: Arriving at the new shore still armed for battle, unable to put down the swords even when the conflict is over.
- **Dissociation**: Detachment become pathological—cutting off from feelings, "leaving" the body, using transition as escape from the present.
- **Spiritual bypassing**: Claiming the journey is complete when it has barely begun. Mistaking the middle of the passage for the far shore.
- **Perpetual transition**: Never arriving, always in passage, using movement to avoid the commitment of settling.

### The Gift of Integration

When the Six of Swords is consciously integrated, it offers these gifts:

**The Wisdom to Leave**: The recognition that some situations cannot be improved, only left behind. The integrated Six knows when to stop fighting and start moving—not from cowardice, but from wisdom.

**Trust in the Guide**: The capacity to accept help, to surrender control, to allow oneself to be ferried by someone who knows the way. This is not passivity but appropriate receptivity.

**Integration of the Past**: The swords stand upright in the boat—they are carried forward, not abandoned. The integrated Six does not deny or forget the past; it carries the lessons without being trapped by them.

**Faith in the Passage**: The far shore cannot be seen clearly from the middle of the crossing. The integrated Six trusts that the passage leads somewhere, that the calm waters are real, that arrival will come.

**Peace After Struggle**: The gift of the Six is peace that is *earned*—not the naive peace of never having suffered, but the deep peace of having suffered, survived, and moved forward. This peace cannot be taken away because it was not given freely; it was won.

### The Central Paradox: Carrying What You're Leaving

The ultimate mystery of the Six of Swords is this: **you carry your past into your future**.

The swords stand in the boat. The passengers could have left them on the shore—traveling lighter, arriving less burdened. But they did not. The swords come with them.

This is the paradox of transition: you cannot truly leave the past behind. You can leave the *situation*, but the *experience* travels with you. The conflicts that shaped you, the struggles that forged you—these are carried across in the boat of your psyche.

The question is not whether to carry the swords, but *how* to carry them. Planted upright, they become markers of passage, monuments to what was survived. Wielded in combat, they would wound the passengers and pierce the boat. The choice is: memory or weapon? Integration or repetition?

The Six of Swords teaches: **take what you've learned and leave the battlefield**. Carry the swords, but stop fighting. Let them stand as witnesses to what you endured, not as tools for continuing the war.

The far shore awaits. The water is calming. The ferryman knows the way.

Trust the passage.
