# Self-Projected Authority
*The Intelligence of the Voice*

---

## Ra's Definition
**Self-Projected Authority** is defined by a **defined [[G Center]]** (Identity Center) connected to the [[Throat]] *without* any motors or higher authorities present (Solar Plexus, Sacral, Spleen, or Heart).[^1]

Self-Projected Authority is **exclusive to [[Projector]]s**—it cannot appear in other Types.[^2]

---

## The Mechanics: Hearing Your Own Voice

Self-Projected Authority operates through the **sound of your own voice**. Truth is not known internally through sensation, emotion, or instinct—it is **heard externally** through the act of speaking.

The G Center governs:[^3]
- **Identity** (who you are)
- **Direction** (where you are going)
- **Love** (who and what you are here for)

When the G Center is connected to the Throat, **identity and direction are articulated**, and clarity emerges through *listening to what you say*.

---

## The Core Principle: "You Must Hear Yourself Speak"

The defining characteristic of Self-Projected Authority is that **truth is revealed through articulation**:[^4]
- You do not know what is correct until you speak it
- You hear your own clarity through the sound of your voice
- The act of speaking is the mechanism of knowing

This is not "thinking out loud"—it is **self-recognition through sound**.

---

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. Wait for the Invitation (Projector Strategy)

Self-Projected Authority must first honor the [[Projector]] [[Strategy]]: **wait for the formal invitation** before engaging with major decisions (career, relationships, relocation).

### 2. Speak in Response to the Invitation

When the invitation arrives:
- **Articulate your thoughts** to trusted others (not to yourself alone)
- **Use them as sounding boards** (they are not advising; they are witnessing)
- **Listen to what you say** (not to what they say)

### 3. Hear Your Own Truth

As you speak:
- **Notice the tone and resonance** of your voice
- **Recognize clarity** when it emerges in your articulation
- **Trust the sound** (not the logic or emotion)

Your truth is heard through:
- The **sound** of your voice (pitch, rhythm, resonance)
- The **consistency** of what you say across multiple conversations
- The **recognition** that "this sounds right"

---

## Somatic Experience

Individuals with Self-Projected Authority experience:
- **Identity through articulation** (you discover who you are by speaking)
- **Direction through dialogue** (you clarify where you're going by talking it out)
- **Vocal resonance** (your truth "sounds right" even if you can't explain why)
- **Need for sounding boards** (trusted others who listen without advising)

The Self-Projected person is **hearing themselves**, not seeking advice. The other person is a mirror, not a guide.

---

## Interaction with Strategy

Self-Projected Authority must be paired with [[Projector]] [[Strategy]]:

1. **Wait for the invitation** (Projector Strategy)
2. **Speak in response to the invitation** (Self-Projected Authority)
3. **Listen to your own voice** to know if the invitation is correct

Strategy positions you correctly (the invitation); Authority reveals *what* is correct (your articulated truth).

---

## The Role of Sounding Boards

Self-Projected Authority requires **trusted others** who can:
- Listen without interrupting
- Witness without advising
- Reflect without projecting their own opinions

The sounding board is not there to *tell you* what to do—they are there to **hear you speak** so you can hear yourself.

### Choosing Correct Sounding Boards

Self-Projected individuals must select sounding boards who:
- Do not impose their agenda
- Allow you to ruminate without judgment
- Are neutral and non-reactive

Incorrect sounding boards (those who advise, pressure, or project) distort the process.

---

## Compatible Types

Self-Projected Authority appears **only** in:
- **Projectors** with a defined G Center connected to the Throat (and no motors or higher authorities defined)

This is a **rare configuration** within the Projector population.

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Seeking Advice Instead of Sounding Boards

Self-Projected Authority is not about *asking others what to do*—it is about **speaking so you can hear yourself**. Confusing sounding boards with advisors distorts the process.

### 2. Deciding in Silence

If you do not speak, you cannot hear your truth. Internal deliberation (mental loops) does not activate Self-Projected Authority.

### 3. Overriding Your Vocal Truth

The mind may disagree with what you hear yourself say. Trusting the *sound* over the *logic* is the practice.

### 4. Using Incorrect Sounding Boards

If your sounding board is invested in a particular outcome, their presence will distort your clarity. Choose neutral witnesses.

## The Gift of Self-Projected Authority

Individuals with Self-Projected Authority bring:
- **Articulat

ed Identity** — They know who they are through speaking
- **Vocal Clarity** — Their truth is heard, not thought or felt
- **Self-Recognition** — They recognize themselves through the sound of their voice
- **Guidance Through Dialogue** — They clarify direction by talking it out

## Strategy Integration

### For Those with Self-Projected Authority

1. **Speak to know.** You cannot hear your truth in silence; articulate your thoughts aloud.
2. **Choose sounding boards carefully.** Find neutral witnesses who listen without advising.
3. **Listen to your own voice.** Pay attention to tone, resonance, and consistency across conversations.
4. **Wait for the invitation first.** Self-Projected Authority works *within* Projector Strategy, not instead of it.
5. **Trust the sound.** If it "sounds right," it is right—even if the mind objects.
6. **Do not decide alone.** You need to speak; internal rumination is not Self-Projected Authority.

### For Those Around Self-Projected Authority Individuals

1. **Be a witness, not an advisor.** Let them speak without interjecting your opinions.
2. **Listen neutrally.** Do not project your agenda onto their decision.
3. **Ask reflective questions.** "What did you just say?" can help them hear themselves.
4. **Do not pressure them to decide in silence.** They need to articulate to know.
5. **Respect their process.** They are not "indecisive"—they are discovering their truth through dialogue.

*Self-Projected Authority is the intelligence of the voice—the recognition that your truth is not known until it is spoken, heard, and recognized through sound. To speak is to know, and to listen to yourself is to witness your own becoming. The sounding board is not your guide but your mirror, and in the resonance of your own voice, you hear who you are and where you are meant to go.*
