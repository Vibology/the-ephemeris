# Primary Health System
*Practical experimentation with dietary regimen*

---

## Introduction: The First Transformation

**Primary Health System (PHS)** is the practical application of the [[Determination]] Variable—the experimental approach to discovering and living your correct dietary regimen.[^1] It is the **first transformation** in the Variable sequence and the most **tangible entry point** for working with the deeper architecture of [[Human Design]].

**The Central Claim:** Your brain and body are designed to be fueled in a **specific way**—not based on nutritional content (calories, macros, vitamins) but on the **conditions and circumstances** under which you eat. Correct dietary regimen, practiced consistently over **seven years**, produces measurable **brain differentiation**—heightened sensory acuity, sharper cognition, improved immune function, and longevity.

**Why PHS matters:**
- It is **experimental**—you can test it immediately (after living Strategy and [[Authority]] for years)
- It is **somatic**—results are felt in the body, not just conceptualized
- It is the **foundation** for accessing the other [[Variables]] ([[Environment]], [[Perspective]], [[Motivation]])
- It challenges cultural conditioning about "healthy eating" and invites radical individualization

**The Structure:** PHS is based on the **Color** of your **Design Sun/Earth** (the unconscious imprint at birth), revealed through **Advanced Imaging** ([[Tone - Color - Base]]) charts.

---

## Historical Context: The Development of PHS

### Ra Uru Hu and Rave Psychology (2000s)

After teaching the surface mechanics of Human Design for nearly two decades (1987-2000s), Ra Uru Hu began revealing the **advanced layer**—Rave Psychology and Primary Health System.

**Why the delay?**
- Variables cannot be accessed without first living Strategy and [[Authority]]
- Teaching PHS prematurely feeds the Not-Self mind's desire for control
- PHS requires **years of experimentation**—it is not a quick fix

**The Innovation:**
Traditional systems (Ayurveda, TCM, naturopathy) recognize that **how** and **when** you eat matters. Ra's contribution was **radical individualization**: 64 hexagrams × 6 colors = **384 possible dietary configurations**, each unique to the individual's Design Crystal imprint.

### The PHS Certification Program

Advanced practitioners trained in PHS use **Advanced Imaging** (Tone/Color/Base matrix) to diagnose and prescribe specific regimens. This is not guesswork—it is a mechanical reading of the chart's substructure.

#### The Process
1. Client receives Advanced Imaging chart
2. Practitioner identifies Design Sun/Earth **Color** (Determination)
3. Practitioner identifies **Tone** (Left or Right orientation)
4. Practitioner identifies **Base** (fine-tuning)
5. Specific dietary regimen is prescribed
6. Client experiments for **seven years** (cellular regeneration cycle)
7. Sensory acuity, digestion, energy, clarity are tracked

**The Claim:** Correct dietary regimen **physically differentiates the brain**, reorganizing neural pathways according to the Design Crystal's original architecture.

## The Six PHS Regimens (Colors 1-6)

### Lower Colors (1-3): Conditions

These regimens focus on the **condition of the food itself**—sequential, selective, temperature.

**Color 1: Appetite (Consecutive)**
- **Practice:** Eat one food at a time; finish each item completely before starting the next
- **Why:** Digestive system differentiates by isolating nutrient streams
- **Challenge:** Nearly all prepared foods are mixtures

**Color 2: Taste (Restrictive/Open)**
- **Practice:** Develop a core menu of 5-10 foods; eat these repeatedly for months; change only with seasons
- **Why:** Gut microbiome optimizes for repeated nutrient profiles
- **Challenge:** Cultural conditioning values "variety" and "balanced diets"

**Color 3: Thirst (Hot/Cold)**
- **Practice (Hot):** Eat food warmer than 98.6°F/37°C
- **Practice (Cold):** Eat food cooler than body temperature
- **Why:** Thermal dynamics aid enzymatic breakdown
- **Challenge:** We often eat food at room temperature without awareness

### Upper Colors (4-6): Circumstances

These regimens focus on the **atmosphere/environment** while eating.

**Color 4: Touch (Calm/Nervous)**
- **Practice (Calm):** Eat in quiet, peaceful environments without distraction
- **Practice (Nervous):** Eat in active, stimulating environments (conversation, music, walking)
- **Why:** Nervous system and digestive system are intimately linked
- **Challenge:** We eat on autopilot (at desks, in cars, in front of screens)

**Color 5: Sound (High/Low)**
- **Practice (High):** Eat with loud music, conversation, or ambient noise
- **Practice (Low):** Eat in complete silence or very soft sounds
- **Why:** Auditory system and digestive system are neurologically linked
- **Challenge:** We rarely control the soundscape

**Color 6: Light (Direct/Indirect)**
- **Practice (Direct):** Eat only during daylight hours; cease before sunset
- **Practice (Indirect):** Eat only during darkness; main meals after sunset or "sleep on food"
- **Why:** Circadian rhythm governs digestive enzyme production
- **Challenge:** Social schedules ignore solar timing

**See:** [[Determination]] for comprehensive treatment of all six Colors.

## The Experimental Process: Step by Step

### Prerequisites

**1. You must be living Strategy and [[Authority]] consistently.**
If you are still in the Not-Self mind, PHS experiments will only feed mental control. The body must be driving decisions before dietary differentiation can occur.

**2. You must know your Determination Color.**
This requires a full Human Design chart with **Advanced Imaging** (Tone/Color/Base calculations). Standard chart software does not show this. Consult a certified PHS practitioner or advanced Human Design analyst.

**3. You must approach this as **experiment**, not dogma.**
PHS is about **testing and observing**, not rigid adherence. The body's feedback is more authoritative than perfect compliance.

### Phase 1: Baseline Observation (Weeks 1-4)

#### Practice
- Eat **normally** (whatever you currently eat)
- Track daily: Energy levels, digestion quality, mental clarity, sleep quality, mood
- **Do not change anything yet**—just observe

**Tools:**
- Simple journal or tracking app
- Note patterns: Does energy crash after certain meals? Does digestion improve/worsen with specific foods or times?

**Why this matters:**
You need a **baseline** to compare against. Without it, you won't know if PHS practice creates changes.

### Phase 2: Introduction (Weeks 5-8)

#### Practice
- Begin practicing your Determination Color with **one meal per day** (e.g., breakfast)
- Example: If Color 1 (Appetite), eat breakfast consecutively—one food at a time
- Continue eating normally for other meals
- Track the same metrics

**What to notice:**
- **Immediate effects:** Digestion, energy, clarity during/after the PHS meal vs. non-PHS meals
- **Challenges:** What makes this difficult? Social pressure? Convenience? Mental resistance?

**Why start small:**
Attempting to practice PHS with all meals immediately is overwhelming. One meal allows you to test without burnout.

### Phase 3: Expansion (Weeks 9-16)

#### Practice
- Increase to **two meals per day** aligned with your Color
- Continue tracking
- **Notice differences** between baseline and practice

**What to notice:**
- **Cumulative effects:** Are benefits amplifying over weeks? Stabilizing? Plateauing?
- **Consistency:** Can you maintain practice 80% of the time, or does life constantly disrupt?

**Adjust as needed:**
If two meals feels unsustainable, return to one meal. PHS is about **long-term patterns**, not perfection.

### Phase 4: Full Practice (Months 5-7)

#### Practice
- Attempt to practice your Color with **all meals**
- This is challenging—social meals, travel, convenience all create obstacles
- **Aim for 80% consistency**, not perfection

**What to notice:**
- **Long-term baseline:** How does sustained practice affect your overall energy, clarity, digestion?
- **Social navigation:** How do you maintain practice while eating with others?

**Reality check:**
Very few people achieve 100% consistency. Life happens. The goal is **directional alignment**, not rigid adherence.

### Phase 5: Integration (Year 1+)

#### Practice
- Correct eating becomes **natural**—the body craves its correct regimen
- You no longer "try" to eat correctly—the body **rejects** incorrect circumstances
- Sensory acuity sharpens—taste, smell, texture become more refined
- Decision-making clarity increases—brain differentiation is occurring

**What to notice:**
- **Aversion:** The body instinctively avoids incorrect eating (e.g., a Color 1 being feels repulsed by mixed foods)
- **Craving:** The body seeks correct eating (e.g., a Color 6 Direct being feels hungry only during daylight)
- **Clarity:** Mental fog lifts; awareness heightens

**Timeline:**
**Seven years** for full cellular regeneration and brain differentiation. This is not a quick fix—it is a life practice.

## Left vs. Right: Strategic vs. Receptive Practice

Your **Tone** (revealed in Advanced Imaging) determines whether you approach PHS **strategically** (Left) or **receptively** (Right).

### Left PHS (Strategic - Tones 1, 3, 5)

**Orientation:**
- **Actively manages** the dietary regimen
- Plans, prepares, controls eating circumstances
- Studies, tracks, analyzes results

**Example (Color 1 Appetite - Left):**
- Strategically meal-preps deconstructed dishes (separate containers for each food)
- Actively ensures consecutive eating at every meal
- Takes notes on digestion, energy, clarity

**Gifts:**
- Precision and control
- Rapid experimentation and adjustment
- Clear data tracking

#### Shadows
- Rigidity and perfectionism
- Overthinking and analysis paralysis
- Losing somatic awareness in pursuit of "doing it right"

### Right PHS (Receptive - Tones 2, 4, 6)

**Orientation:**
- **Passively gravitates** toward the dietary regimen
- Absorbs, allows, trusts the body's intelligence
- Minimal planning or tracking

**Example (Color 1 Appetite - Right):**
- Instinctively rejects mixed foods without conscious effort
- Body naturally craves one food at a time
- No need to "try"—the regimen emerges organically

**Gifts:**
- Effortlessness and flow
- Deep somatic trust
- Natural alignment without force

#### Shadows
- Passivity and lack of structure
- Difficulty navigating social/convenience obstacles
- "Hoping it works" without testing

**Neither is better**—they are mechanical orientations. Honor your Tone.

## PHS and the Other Variables

### The Sequence: Determination First

PHS (Determination) is the **gateway** to the other Variables. You cannot access [[Environment]], [[Perspective]], or [[Motivation]] correctly without first cleaning the internal system through correct dietary regimen.

**Why?**
- The brain is the processing unit
- If the brain is clouded by incorrect fueling, it cannot perceive correct Environment, hold correct Perspective, or operate from true Motivation
- Everything downstream depends on upstream differentiation

**Timeline:**
- **Years 1-7:** Live by Strategy and [[Authority]]
- **Year 7+:** Begin PHS experimentation ([[Determination]])
- **Year 14+:** The body gravitates toward correct [[Environment]]
- **Year 21+:** [[Perspective]] and [[Motivation]] stabilize naturally

**No shortcuts.** Attempting to "be in the right Environment" or "see correctly" while still eating incorrectly is mechanically impossible.

### PHS and Sensory Acuity

Correct dietary regimen **heightens sensory awareness**—taste, smell, touch, hearing, sight become more refined.

**Why?**
The six Colors correspond to the six **Tones** ([[Tone - Color - Base]]):
- **Colors 1-2** (Appetite, Taste) → **Tones 1-2** (Smell, Taste cognition)
- **Colors 3-4** (Thirst, Touch) → **Tones 3-4** (Outer/Inner Vision cognition)
- **Colors 5-6** (Sound, Light) → **Tones 5-6** (Feeling, Touch cognition)

**Practicing your Color differentiates your Tone**—the sensory-cognitive system underlying your brain.

**Result:** After years of correct eating, you **literally sense reality differently**—more acutely, more uniquely.

## Working with a PHS Practitioner

### When to Consult a Practitioner

**Ideal timing:**
- You have been living Strategy and [[Authority]] for **7+ years**
- You are ready to commit to **long-term experimentation** (7-year cycle)
- You want professional guidance interpreting your **Advanced Imaging** chart

**What a practitioner offers:**
- Precise diagnosis of your Design Sun/Earth **Color, Tone, Base**
- Explanation of your specific dietary regimen
- Guidance on Left vs. Right orientation (Strategic vs. Receptive practice)
- Ongoing support and adjustment as you experiment

### What to Expect

**Initial Consultation:**
- Review of your Advanced Imaging chart
- Explanation of your Determination Color and regimen
- Discussion of challenges (social, logistical, psychological)
- Experimentation plan tailored to your life

**Follow-Up Sessions:**
- Tracking progress (energy, digestion, clarity, sensory acuity)
- Troubleshooting obstacles
- Adjusting practice based on feedback
- Supporting long-term commitment

**Cost:**
PHS consultations are typically high-investment ($200-$500+ per session) because this is **advanced, specialized work**. Practitioners have trained for years.

### DIY Approach

**If you have your Advanced Imaging chart and understand your Color**, you can begin experimenting on your own using the guidance in [[Determination]] and this entry.

**Advantages:**
- Immediate start (no waiting for appointments)
- Lower cost
- Full autonomy

**Disadvantages:**
- No expert guidance for troubleshooting
- Risk of misinterpreting Tone/Color/Base
- Requires self-discipline and tracking

**Recommendation:** Start DIY; consult a practitioner if you encounter confusion or want deeper support.

## Shadows of PHS Practice

### 1. Orthorexia and Food Obsession

**The Danger:** PHS becomes another form of **eating disorder**—obsessive control over every bite, moral judgments about "correct" vs. "incorrect" eating.

**Example:** A Color 1 (Appetite) being refusing to eat anything that isn't perfectly consecutive, creating anxiety, isolation, and rigidity.

#### Antidote
- Remember—PHS is an **invitation to experiment**, not a commandment
- The body's intelligence (Strategy and Authority) is more authoritative than perfect adherence
- **Flexibility** is healthy—occasionally eating "incorrectly" to maintain relationships or navigate life is valid

### 2. Mental Override

**The Danger:** The Not-Self mind **forcing** the body to comply with PHS, overriding somatic feedback.

**Example:** A Color 6 (Indirect) being forcing themselves to eat late at night even though their body signals exhaustion, because "the chart says I should."

#### Antidote
- **Strategy and Authority override PHS**
- If your Sacral says "no" to eating at night, honor that—even if you're Color 6 Indirect
- The body knows

### 3. Social Alienation

**The Danger:** Using PHS as an excuse to withdraw from communal eating, creating isolation and superiority.

**Example:** "I can't eat with you—I'm Color 4 Calm and your conversation is too loud. You're disrupting my digestion."

#### Antidote
- Relationships matter more than perfect regimen
- Occasionally eating in "incorrect" circumstances to maintain connection is healthy
- PHS is about **long-term patterns**, not every single meal

### 4. Nutritional Reductionism

**The Danger:** Ignoring the **content** of food entirely, assuming that "correct circumstances" compensate for poor nutrition.

**Example:** A Color 3 (Hot) being eating junk food because "as long as it's hot, it doesn't matter what it is."

#### Antidote
- PHS describes **how** to eat, not **what** to eat
- Quality still matters—whole foods, nutrient density, freshness
- Correct circumstances **amplify** good nutrition; they don't replace it

### 5. Spiritual Bypassing

**The Danger:** Using PHS to avoid deeper psychological or relational work.

**Example:** "I don't need therapy—I just need to eat correctly and my brain will differentiate."

**Reality:** PHS supports differentiation, but it is **not** a replacement for therapy, shadow work, or relational healing.

**Antidote:** PHS is **one layer** of the work. Honor all layers—somatic, psychological, relational, spiritual.

## Tracking and Metrics

### What to Track

**Subjective Metrics:**
- **Energy levels** (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Mental clarity** (focus, decision-making, creativity)
- **Mood** (stability, positivity, emotional resilience)
- **Sleep quality** (depth, restfulness, dreams)
- **Digestion** (bloating, regularity, comfort)

**Objective Metrics:**
- **Weight/body composition** (if relevant to your health)
- **Sensory acuity** (taste, smell—do flavors become more distinct over time?)
- **Immune function** (frequency of illness)

### How to Track

**Simple Journal:**
- Daily 1-5 rating for each metric
- Brief notes on challenges, insights, observations

**Tracking App:**
- Use wellness apps (e.g., Daylio, Exist, custom spreadsheet)
- Visual graphs help identify patterns over weeks/months

**Body Awareness:**
- Pay attention to **somatic feedback**—does your body feel lighter, clearer, more vital?
- Notice **aversions** (rejecting incorrect eating) and **cravings** (seeking correct eating)

### Long-Term Patterns

**Weeks 1-4 (Baseline):** No changes expected—just observing
**Weeks 5-12 (Introduction):** Subtle shifts—slight improvements in energy, digestion
**Months 4-12 (Expansion):** Noticeable changes—clearer mind, sharper senses, stable energy
**Years 1-3 (Integration):** Significant differentiation—body craves correct eating, rejects incorrect
**Years 4-7 (Full Cycle):** Brain differentiation complete—sensory acuity, cognitive clarity, immune strength at peak

**Be patient.** PHS is a **long game**.

## Correspondences

### Ayurveda: Agni and Digestive Fire

**Parallel:** Ayurveda teaches that **Agni (digestive fire)** is strengthened by eating at correct times, in calm environments, with proper food combinations.

**Difference:** Ayurveda categorizes people into three broad doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha). PHS offers **384 individualized configurations**.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine: Spleen Qi

**Parallel:** TCM teaches that **Spleen Qi** (digestive capacity) is strengthened by warm foods, regular meal timing, and calm eating.

**Difference:** TCM prescribes based on constitutional patterns. PHS prescribes based on Design Crystal imprint.

### Intermittent Fasting and Circadian Eating

**Parallel:** Modern research on **circadian rhythms** supports Color 6 (Light) regimens—eating during daylight (Direct) or nighttime (Indirect) aligns with hormonal cycles.

**Integration:** PHS individualizes circadian eating—some are designed for day eating, some for night.

### Jungian Psychology: The Body as Unconscious

**Parallel:** Jung recognized the **body as carrier of unconscious intelligence**. PHS aligns—the Design Crystal (unconscious) determines dietary needs, not the Personality (conscious mind).

**Integration:** [[Anima et Algorithm]]—PHS is the **Anima's fuel source**. Correct eating differentiates the body, allowing embodied knowing (Anima) to emerge.
