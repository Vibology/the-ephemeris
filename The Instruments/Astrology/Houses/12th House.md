# 12th House
*Dissolution and the Return to Source*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **12th House** is the **"Evil Daemon"** (traditional name)—the place of hidden enemies, self-undoing, imprisonment, and all that dissolves form. But it is also the house of **mysticism**, spiritual retreat, and the direct encounter with the numinous. It is **Pisces's domain**: the ocean to which all rivers return, the dissolution that precedes rebirth.

Where the 1st House is the first breath, the 12th House is the **final exhale**. Where the 11th House builds community, the 12th House **dissolves into solitude**. The 12th House is the end of the cycle—the completion before the new beginning (1st House) can emerge.

Lilly describes the 12th House as governing "private enemies, witches, great cattle (horses, oxen), sorrow, imprisonment, and self-undoing."[^1]
