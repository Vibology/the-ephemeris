# Authority
*The Inner Intelligence of Decision-Making*

---

## Overview

**Authority** in Human Design is the body's inner intelligence for determining what is correct—the somatic compass that reveals truth when [[Strategy]] has positioned you properly.[^1] Where Strategy governs *how* you engage with life's opportunities, Authority determines *what* is true for you within that engagement.

Authority is not mental. The mind thinks, analyzes, compares, and worries—but it is not designed to make decisions for your life. The mind's correct role is **Outer Authority**: witnessing, articulating, offering perspective to others. **Inner Authority**—the decision-making intelligence that guides your own life—belongs to the body.

Each Authority type corresponds to a specific defined Center (or configuration of Centers) in the [[The BodyGraph|BodyGraph]]. The defined Center with highest priority in the hierarchy becomes your Authority, overriding all centers below it.

---

## The Authority Hierarchy

Human Design establishes a strict **hierarchy of Authority** based on Center definition.[^2] If multiple potential Authority centers are defined, only the highest in the hierarchy operates as your decision-making intelligence:

| Rank | Authority | Source | Principle |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | [[Emotional Authority]] | [[Solar Plexus]] | "No truth in the now"—ride the wave to clarity |
| 2 | [[Sacral Authority]] | [[Sacral]] | Gut response—"uh-huh" or "uhn-un" |
| 3 | [[Splenic Authority]] | [[Spleen]] | Instantaneous instinct—speaks once |
| 4 | [[Ego Authority]] | [[Heart]] | Willpower and commitment—"What do I want?" |
| 5 | [[Self-Projected Authority]] | [[G Center]] → [[Throat]] | Vocal articulation—hear yourself speak |
| 6 | [[Mental Authority]] | [[Head]]/[[Ajna]] only | Environment and dialogue—external clarity |
| 7 | Lunar Authority | No defined Centers | 28-day sampling cycle ([[Reflector]] only) |

**The rule is simple:** If your Solar Plexus is defined, you have Emotional Authority—regardless of what else is defined. If your Solar Plexus is *undefined* but your Sacral is defined, you have Sacral Authority. And so on down the hierarchy.

## The Seven Authorities

### Emotional Authority
*Clarity Through the Wave*

**Source:** Defined [[Solar Plexus]] Center
**Compatible Types:** [[Manifestor]], [[Generator]], [[Projector]]
**Population:** ~50% of humanity[^3]

The most common Authority. Decisions emerge through the **emotional wave**—an oscillating biochemical process of hope and pain that must complete before clarity appears. The core principle: **"There is no truth in the now."**[^4] Wait for the wave to settle into calm waters, where the decision feels consistent regardless of emotional state.

→ [[Emotional Authority]]

---

### Sacral Authority
*The Intelligence of the Gut*

**Source:** Defined [[Sacral]] Center (without defined Solar Plexus)
**Compatible Types:** [[Generator]], Manifesting Generator
**Population:** ~35% of humanity

The intelligence of immediate, non-verbal response. The Sacral speaks in guttural sounds—**"uh-huh"** (yes, energy available) or **"uhn-un"** (no, energy not available)—before the mind can intervene.[^5] Requires an external stimulus (a yes/no question, an offer) to activate.

→ [[Sacral Authority]]

---

### Splenic Authority
*The Intelligence of the Now*

**Source:** Defined [[Spleen]] Center (without defined Solar Plexus or Sacral)
**Compatible Types:** [[Manifestor]], [[Projector]]
**Population:** ~11% of humanity

The body's survival intelligence—instantaneous, instinctual, and non-repeating. The Spleen speaks **once** as a subtle knowing in the moment. If you miss it, it does not return. Requires absolute presence and trust in the body's first impulse.

→ [[Splenic Authority]]

---

### Ego Authority
*The Intelligence of Willpower*

**Source:** Defined [[Heart]] Center (without defined Solar Plexus, Sacral, or Spleen)
**Compatible Types:** [[Manifestor]] (Ego-Manifested), [[Projector]] (Ego-Projected)
**Population:** Rare (<4%)

Decisions rooted in **will and commitment**—what you genuinely *want*, not what you *should* do. Expresses as Ego-Manifested (Heart → Throat: truth discovered through speaking) or Ego-Projected (Heart → G Center: truth discovered through self-inquiry).

→ [[Ego Authority]]

---

### Self-Projected Authority
*The Intelligence of the Voice*

**Source:** [[G Center]] connected to [[Throat]] (no motors or higher authorities defined)
**Compatible Types:** [[Projector]] only
**Population:** Very rare (<3%)

Truth is not known internally—it is **heard externally** through the sound of your own voice. Requires trusted sounding boards (not advisors) who witness your articulation without projecting their agenda. Clarity emerges through listening to what you say across multiple conversations.

→ [[Self-Projected Authority]]

---

### Mental Authority
*The Intelligence of Environment*

**Source:** Only [[Head]], [[Ajna]], and/or [[Throat]] defined (no centers below Throat)
**Compatible Types:** [[Projector]] only
**Population:** Very rare (<2%)

Also called **Environmental Authority** or **No Inner Authority**. The mind thinks but does not decide. Clarity comes through **dialogue with trusted advisors** and **sampling the environment**—sensing whether a space, community, or opportunity is healthy for you. Requires time and accumulated external data.

→ [[Mental Authority]]

---

### Lunar Authority
*The Intelligence of the Moon*

**Source:** No defined Centers (complete openness)
**Compatible Types:** [[Reflector]] only
**Population:** ~1% of humanity[^6]

The rarest Authority, belonging to the rarest Type. With no fixed definition, Reflectors are designed to **sample the full spectrum** of energy over a complete lunar cycle (approximately 28 days).[^7] Major decisions require waiting through this cycle, allowing the Moon's transit to activate each Gate sequentially and reveal what is consistently correct.

→ [[Reflector]]

---

## Authority by Type

| Type | Possible Authorities |
|------|---------------------|
| [[Manifestor]] | Emotional, Splenic, Ego-Manifested |
| [[Generator]] | Emotional, Sacral |
| Manifesting Generator | Emotional, Sacral |
| [[Projector]] | Emotional, Splenic, Ego-Projected, Self-Projected, Mental |
| [[Reflector]] | Lunar (exclusively) |

**Generators** (including Manifesting Generators) can only have Emotional or Sacral Authority—their defined Sacral limits the options.

**Projectors** have the widest range of possible Authorities—five distinct types—reflecting their diverse configurations.

**Reflectors** have no choice; their complete openness mandates Lunar Authority.

## Authority and Deconditioning

The practice of living according to your Authority is the heart of **[[Deconditioning]]**—the process of liberating the body's intelligence from the mind's conditioned control. For most people, years (even decades) of mental decision-making have overridden the body's natural knowing.

The experiment is simple:
1. Learn your Authority
2. Follow it for every decision (small and large)
3. Observe the results over time (Ra Uru Hu suggested a 7-year experiment)[^8]

As you trust Authority over mind, the **Signature** of your Type emerges—Peace (Manifestor), Satisfaction (Generator), Success (Projector), Surprise (Reflector)—confirming alignment with your design.

## Cross-References

### Within Human Design
- [[Strategy]] — How to engage with life; Authority operates *within* correct Strategy
- [[Centers]] — The nine energy hubs; defined Centers determine Authority
- [[Types]] — The Four Types and their compatible Authorities
- [[Deconditioning]] — The process of returning to body-based decision-making

### Individual Authorities
- [[Emotional Authority]] — The wave; "no truth in the now"
- [[Sacral Authority]] — The gut response; "uh-huh" or "uhn-un"
- [[Splenic Authority]] — Instinct in the moment; speaks once
- [[Ego Authority]] — Willpower; what you want
- [[Self-Projected Authority]] — The voice; hearing yourself speak
- [[Mental Authority]] — Environment and dialogue; external clarity

### Cross-System Integration
- [[The Transcendent Function]] — Jungian parallel: the body as oracle, mediating conscious and unconscious
- [[Synchronicity]] — Authority as alignment with the meaningful pattern of the moment
- [[The High Priestess (II)]] — Tarot parallel: the inner knowing that cannot be explained

*Authority is the body's answer to the mind's endless question: "But how do I know?" The mind knows through logic, comparison, and analysis—but these tools are not designed for the irreducible particularity of your life. The body knows differently: through wave and response, instinct and will, voice and environment. To trust Authority is to recognize that you are not a mind piloting a body but a body expressing consciousness—and the body already knows how to move correctly. Your only task is to listen.*
