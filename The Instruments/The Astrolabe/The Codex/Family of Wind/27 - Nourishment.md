# Nourishment
*Mountain above Wind — Sustaining life through mindful care*

---

## Core Identity

Nourishment teaches that sustaining life is sacred work—not just feeding the body but *caring for what allows life to continue*. Mountain above Wind creates the image of stillness above gentle penetration: the mouth (upper and lower jaw) that receives food carefully, processes it mindfully, and distributes nourishment to the body. This is the hexagram of *responsible care*, the recognition that what you take in and what you give out determines survival.

In Human Design, Gate 27 anchors in the Sacral Center—the life force generator, the motor for doing, the biological yes/no. This gate governs *caring*—the sacral impulse to nurture, sustain, and take responsibility for what needs nourishment. The Tribal Defense Circuit carries this gate's frequency: caring for the tribe through material support, ensuring everyone is fed. The 27-50 Channel of Preservation connects Sacral to Spleen, creating the guardian of tribal values—the one who determines what is nourishing and what is toxic, what should be allowed in and what must be excluded.

Wilhelm writes: "THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH. Perseverance brings good fortune. Pay heed to the providing of nourishment and to what a man seeks to fill his own mouth with." The teaching has two edges: attend to *what* you feed yourself (physically, mentally, spiritually) and *whom* you are responsible for feeding. The Image states: "At the foot of the mountain, thunder: the image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT. Thus the superior man is careful of his words and temperate in eating and drinking."

The alchemical image is *Nutritio*—the feeding stage where the alchemical child (product of conjunction) must be carefully nourished to maturity. Nourishment recognizes that *creation requires sustenance*; what is born must be fed or it dies. This applies to relationships, projects, communities, and self.

### The Hexagram (I-Ching)

Hexagram 27, *I* (Providing Nourishment), depicts Mountain above Wind with a distinctive structure: strong yang lines at top and bottom (upper and lower jaw) with four yin lines between (the open mouth).[^1] The hexagram *is* the image of the mouth—what receives and distributes nourishment. Wilhelm's Judgment emphasizes discernment: "Pay heed to the providing of nourishment and to what a man seeks to fill his own mouth with." The teaching: you are what you consume; care what you take in. The Image links nourishment to restraint: "careful of his words" (what comes out of the mouth) and "temperate in eating and drinking" (what goes in).

### The Gate (Human Design)

Gate 27 in the Sacral governs the impulse to care—not as emotion but as *life force commitment* to sustaining what matters. Ra Uru Hu taught that this gate carries "the capacity to take responsibility for nourishing"—self, family, tribe, community.[^2] When connected to Gate 50 in the Spleen, the 27-50 Channel creates *Preservation*—Sacral caring meets Spleen discrimination, determining what nourishes the tribe and what threatens it. This is the guardian of values: who gets fed, what beliefs are supported, what behaviors are tolerated. The challenge: to care for self *and* others without collapsing into martyrdom or selfishness.

### The Gene Keys

- **Shadow: Selfishness**[^3] — The collapse into taking without giving; hoarding nourishment, refusing responsibility for others. Selfishness is the person who feeds only themselves, who exploits communal resources without contributing, who demands care but offers none. The Shadow is the infantile state: "feed me, but I owe you nothing." Also: the inverted selfishness of the martyr who gives compulsively to avoid receiving, creating debt rather than reciprocity.

- **Gift: Altruism** — The capacity to nourish others *from overflow* rather than from depletion. Altruism recognizes that caring is reciprocal: I feed you, you feed the tribe, the tribe feeds me. The gift is sustainable care—feeding self adequately so that caring for others does not become self-destruction. Altruism is the mother who puts on her own oxygen mask first; the teacher who maintains boundaries; the leader who cares for the collective without martyring themselves.

- **Siddhi: Selflessness** — The recognition that nourishment is universal—that in feeding another, you feed yourself; in caring for the whole, you are cared for. At this frequency, the boundary between self and other dissolves: there is only Life nourishing itself through countless forms. Selflessness is not self-denial but *self-transparency*: you become a clear channel through which care flows without obstruction. The mystic discovers that all giving is receiving, all receiving is giving, because there is only One being fed.

## Synthesis Notes

### Family Context

This card belongs to the **Family of Wind** — the gentle foundation. Wind provides the persistent, careful influence, while Mountain above represents the containment necessary for nourishment—the mouth that holds food long enough to chew, the vessel that protects what is developing. Nourishment teaches that care requires both *receiving* (gentle acceptance of what enters) and *discrimination* (stillness that determines what is actually nourishing).

### Archetypal Resonance

Nourishment resonates with the **Mother archetype**—not only biological mothering but the *caring principle* that sustains life. In Greek tradition, Demeter whose grief stops the harvest until her daughter returns—nourishment as sacred responsibility. In Christian iconography, the nursing Madonna—the recognition that God must be fed before God can feed others. The archetype teaches that *caring is power*, that the capacity to nourish creates dependency (shadow) or reciprocal bond (gift).

In Jungian terms, Nourishment engages the **Great Mother in her nourishing aspect**—the positive mother who feeds, sustains, protects. Jung distinguished this from the Terrible Mother who devours; Gate 27 at gift level is the healthy boundary: feed what needs feeding, refuse to feed what would consume you.

### Cross-System Convergence

Nourishment aligns with Qabalah's **Chesed**—Mercy, the sphere of Jupiter, the overflowing benevolence that gives freely. Chesed is nourishment without calculation, care without condition—but balanced by Geburah's discrimination. In Tarot, Gate 27 resonates with **The Empress** (III)—the mother who feeds, the earth that sustains, embodied care. Also **Six of Pentacles**—reciprocal exchange, giving and receiving in balance.

## Shadow Aspect

**When Altruism becomes Selfishness:** The Sacral impulse to care collapses into taking without giving, or giving without receiving. The Shadow manifests in two directions: (1) the parasite who feeds off others' care without reciprocating—the adult child still expecting to be mothered, the partner who takes endlessly without contributing, the community member who consumes resources without supporting them; (2) the martyr who gives compulsively, depleting themselves to prove worth—the mother who refuses all help, the caregiver who burns out, the person whose "selflessness" is actually manipulation through guilt.

The conditioning pattern: "I deserve to be cared for without reciprocating" or "I am only worthy if I care for everyone else." Both create imbalanced exchange. The Not-Self strategy is either to hoard nourishment (selfishness as defense against scarcity) or to give it all away (martyrdom as defense against unworthiness). The result: broken relationships, resentment, cycles of depletion and exploitation.

Another Shadow trap: indiscriminate feeding. If one lacks the Spleen's discrimination (Gate 50), Gate 27's caring can feed *everything*—including what should not be sustained. This manifests as the parent who enables addiction, the leader who supports destructive members, the person whose "open heart" allows toxic people to exploit them. Nourishment without discernment becomes codependence.

## Oracle Reading

### When This Card Appears

**Core Message:** Examine what you are feeding and what is feeding you. Nourishment is reciprocal: you cannot pour from an empty cup, and you cannot fill indefinitely without depleting the source. Are you caring for yourself adequately? Are you taking responsibility for sustaining what you brought into being? Are you feeding relationships that feed you back, or martyring yourself for those who only take? Pay attention to *what* you consume—food yes, but also media, relationships, beliefs. Nourishment determines vitality. Feed yourself well, then feed others from overflow.

**Shadow Warning:** Beware selfishness in both directions. If you are taking without giving, you are parasitic; if you are giving without receiving, you are martyring. Neither is sustainable. Altruism is *reciprocal*: I feed you, you feed the tribe, the tribe feeds me. Check the exchange: is it balanced? Also beware indiscriminate feeding—caring for what should not be sustained. Not everything deserves your life force. Some relationships, projects, beliefs are toxic; feeding them depletes you without nourishing anyone. Learn to say: "I will not feed this."

**Gift Invitation:** You have the capacity for *altruism*—sustainable care that nourishes without depleting. You understand that caring for self is not selfish but *prerequisite* for caring for others. Your responsibility extends to everything you brought into being: children, projects, communities, commitments. Feed them. But also: receive. Let yourself be fed. The gift is reciprocity: giving and receiving in balance, caring that strengthens rather than exhausts. Your capacity to nourish creates bonds, sustains tribes, keeps life flowing. This is sacred work: you are the guardian of what continues.

**Siddhi Vision:** At the highest octave, you realize that nourishment is one movement: Life feeding itself through infinite forms. When you feed another, you are fed. When you receive care, you are caring. The boundary between giver and receiver dissolves into *exchange*—the eternal circulation of energy that sustains all being. Selflessness is not sacrifice but *transparency*: you become the clear vessel through which care flows without obstruction. The mother nursing the child is simultaneously the child nursing the mother; the teacher feeding the student is the student feeding the teacher. You stop counting—who gave what, who owes whom—because you see there is only One being nourished. This is the ultimate teaching: in caring for the least, you care for God; in feeding the hungry, you are fed.
