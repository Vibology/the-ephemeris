# The Nine Centers
*Energy Hubs of the BodyGraph*

---

## Overview

The **Nine Centers** are the energy hubs of the Human Design BodyGraph, corresponding to biological systems and psychological functions.[^1] Derived from the Hindu-Brahmin chakra system and synthesized with Kabbalistic and astrological frameworks, the Centers represent the primary nodes through which life force circulates.

Each Center governs specific themes—mental pressure, emotional chemistry, identity, willpower, communication, instinct, vitality, and drive. Centers are either **defined** (colored in) or **undefined** (white), determining whether that energy operates as a consistent, reliable force or as a receptive, sampling intelligence.

## Defined vs. Undefined

**Defined Centers** represent:
- Consistent, reliable energy
- Fixed aspects of your nature
- What you broadcast to others
- Where you are not conditioned by others

**Undefined Centers** represent:
- Receptive, amplifying energy
- Where you sample and learn from others
- Potential wisdom through observation
- Where conditioning operates most strongly

The wisdom of Human Design lies in recognizing that undefined Centers are not weaknesses but **schools**—places where you develop discernment through exposure to variety.
