# Shaddai El Chai
*Almighty Living God — The Divine Name of Yesod*

---

## Overview

**Shaddai El Chai** (Hebrew: שדי אל חי, "Almighty Living God") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Yesod]]** (Foundation), the ninth Sephirah on the [[The Tree of Life]] — the sphere of the Moon, the astral plane, dreams, imagination, and the generative foundation that channels all higher energies into physical manifestation.

The name combines two components:
- **Shaddai** (שדי) — "Almighty" or "The Sufficient One." The Zohar derives this from *she-dai* — "**who said 'Enough!'**" — the divine power that *limits the spread of chaos*, imposing boundaries on the formless so that creation can take shape.[^1]
- **El Chai** (אל חי) — "Living God," emphasizing the dynamic, animating life-force. Not a static deity but a *living* one — the vitality that pulses through creation.

Together the name announces: the God who sets boundaries *and* fills them with life. Structure and vitality. Form and breath. This is Yesod's essential function: to be the **last gateway** through which divine energy passes before entering the physical world of [[Malkuth]].

## Source Teachings

### The Zohar: "Enough!"

The Zohar's etymology of *Shaddai* — from *she-dai*, "who said 'Enough!'" — reveals a crucial cosmological principle: creation requires *limitation*.[^1] Without a boundary, the infinite light of [[Ain Soph Aur]] would overwhelm all vessels, and nothing particular could exist. Shaddai is the name of the God who knows when to stop — who says "this far and no further" to the creative force pouring down the Tree.

This is why Shaddai is associated with Yesod: the Foundation is where the accumulated energies of the eight Sephiroth above are **filtered, bounded, and shaped** into the specific forms that will manifest in Malkuth. Yesod says "enough" to the infinite and translates it into the finite.

### The Zohar: The Vitality of the Worlds

The Zohar calls *El Chai* the "**Vitality of the Worlds**" — the generative principle that channels life into Malkuth (the Shekinah, the physical world).[^2] Yesod is frequently symbolized as the **phallus** of the divine body — not in a crudely sexual sense but as the generative organ through which the upper Tree *inseminates* the lower. The river that flows from Eden ([[Chokmah]]) through the garden reaches Malkuth through Yesod.

This imagery is explicit in the Zohar: Yesod is the ***Tzaddik*** (the Righteous One), the channel through which divine blessing flows into the world. "The righteous one is the foundation of the world" (Proverbs 10:25) — the Zohar reads this as a statement about Yesod's cosmic function.[^3]

## Shaddai in the Patriarchal Narratives

Before the revelation of YHVH to Moses at the burning bush, God was known to the patriarchs as ***El Shaddai*** (Genesis 17:1 — "I am El Shaddai; walk before me and be blameless"). The Zohar interprets this as the divine name appropriate to the **pre-Mosaic** stage of revelation: God as sustainer, provider, and boundary-setter — the God of natural cycles, fertility, and covenant.[^4]

The shift from El Shaddai (patriarchal period) to YHVH (Mosaic revelation) mirrors the ascent of the Tree: Yesod ([[Shaddai El Chai]]) to Tiphareth ([[YHVH Eloah va-Daath]]). The patriarchs knew God through the Foundation — the rhythms of land, flock, and family. Moses knew God through the Heart — direct encounter with the divine "I Am."

## The Name in Practice

### In the Middle Pillar Exercise

Shaddai El Chai is vibrated at the **fourth station** — the lower abdomen/genitals — while visualizing a sphere of violet or silver light. This center corresponds to the astral body, the dream-life, and the generative vitality of the organism.

The vibration of Shaddai El Chai activates the **foundation of the subtle body**: the practitioner establishes contact with the astral matrix that underlies physical reality, the imaginal field through which higher influences take shape before manifesting.

### Lunar Work

As Yesod's planetary correspondence is the **Moon**, Shaddai El Chai is the name invoked for:
- **Dream work** — Activating the astral doorway through which the unconscious communicates
- **Imagination as practice** — The deliberate use of active imagination (cf. [[Active Imagination]]) to engage archetypal content
- **Purification** — Yesod is the "Pure Intelligence" (*Sekhel Tahor*) that cleanses the astral images before they manifest physically

---

## Jungian Parallels

Yesod corresponds to the **personal unconscious** — the reservoir of dream images, fantasies, repressed content, and personal memories that lies just beneath the threshold of waking consciousness. Shaddai El Chai is the divine name of the **imaginal** — the psychic function that produces images.

The "Almighty Living God" at Yesod is Jung's recognition that the unconscious is not merely a repository of forgotten material but a **living, creative agency** that generates symbols, dreams, and visions with autonomous intelligence.[^5] The images that rise from Yesod are not random noise but *communications* — the psyche's way of mediating between the archetypal depths (the upper Tree) and everyday consciousness (Malkuth).

The "Enough!" of Shaddai parallels the ego's necessary function of **containing** unconscious content — allowing images to emerge without being overwhelmed by them. This is the difference between active imagination (Shaddai — bounded, structured, ego-present) and psychotic flooding (Shaddai absent — the boundary dissolved, chaos unbounded).

## Notes

[^1]: Zohar — Shaddai derived from *she-dai* ("who said 'Enough!'"), the divine power that limits the spread of chaos (*Tohu*) and imposes necessary boundaries on creation.

[^2]: Zohar — *El Chai* ("Living God") as the "Vitality of the Worlds," the generative principle channeling life-force into Malkuth through Yesod.

[^3]: Zohar, commentary on Proverbs 10:25 — "The righteous one (*Tzaddik*) is the foundation (*Yesod*) of the world." The Tzaddik as the cosmic channel of divine blessing.

[^4]: Genesis 17:1 — "I am El Shaddai; walk before me and be blameless." Zohar's interpretation of the patriarchal name as appropriate to the Yesodic (Foundation) stage of divine revelation.

[^5]: Jung, CW 8 (*The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche*) — The autonomous creative activity of the unconscious; the psyche as a self-regulating system that produces symbols with independent intelligence.
