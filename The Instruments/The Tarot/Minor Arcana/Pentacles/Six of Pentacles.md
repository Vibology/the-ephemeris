# Six of Pentacles

*Moon in Taurus - The second decan of Taurus*

---

## Traditional Symbolism
According to Waite's *Pictorial Key to the Tarot*, the Six of Pentacles signifies **presents, gifts, gratification**. [^1] More specifically: **a person in the guise of a merchant weighs money in a pair of scales and distributes it to the needy and distressed**. The upright card speaks to **success in material undertakings, prosperity, philanthropy, generosity**—but also the implicit power dynamics of charity.
The Golden Dawn titles this card the **"Lord of Material Success"** [^2] and attributes it to **Moon in Taurus** [^3], the second decan of the fixed earth sign. This is the planet of cycles, intuition, and emotional tides (Moon) manifesting through the sign of material stability, sensory pleasure, and accumulated wealth (Taurus). The result is **generous flow**—resources circulating from those who have to those who need, but with *emotional discernment*, not blind giving.
The card represents **the restoration of balance after crisis**. The Five showed material hardship and the figures walking past the church door. The Six is *after they knocked*—the door opened, help arrived, resources are being shared. But note: this is not equality. The giver stands; the receivers kneel. The giver holds the scale; the receivers hold out empty hands. Generosity is present—but so is *hierarchy*.
This is a profoundly important card in questions of giving and receiving, wealth and poverty, charity and justice. It indicates that resources are flowing again—the crisis of the Five is resolving. Someone who has abundance is sharing with someone who does not. But the card asks you to examine *how* the exchange is happening: Is it offered freely, or does it create obligation? Does it empower the receiver, or does it bind them to continued dependence? Is the giver generous, or controlling?
When the Six of Pentacles appears **reversed**, Waite identifies meanings of **desire, cupidity, envy, jealousy, illusion**. [^4] The reversal can indicate several dynamics: the generosity becomes *manipulation* (gifts with strings attached), the receiver feels *resentment* (envy of the giver's power), or the giver becomes *stingy* (withholding what was previously shared). The Golden Dawn reversal suggests "unfairness in giving; charity used as control; resentment of those who have more." [^5]
The key teaching: **How you give matters as much as what you give**. The Six of Pentacles offers the opportunity to restore balance, to share abundance, to lift others from poverty—but if the giving comes from ego (to be seen as generous), or creates dependency (the receiver can never rise to equality), or reinforces hierarchy (reminding the poor of their place), then the gift becomes a chain.

## Divination Use
**Upright:** Material success, prosperity, the capacity to give from abundance. Gifts, philanthropy, charity, generosity. Resources flowing from those who have to those who need. Fair distribution (or at least, distribution according to some principle of justice). The restoration of balance after the crisis of the Five. Help arrives, the door opens, the sanctuary shares its pentacles. But also: the power dynamics of charity—the giver stands above, the receiver kneels below. The one who gives holds the scale and decides who receives what.
*Keywords:* Generosity, charity, gifts, success, prosperity, balance restored, fair distribution, giving and receiving, philanthropy, power dynamics.
**Reversed (per Waite):** Desire, cupidity, envy, jealousy, illusion. The generosity becomes manipulation—gifts with strings attached, charity used to control or obligate. Or the receiver resents the giver's power, envies their wealth, feels humiliated by needing help. Or the giver becomes stingy, withholding what was previously shared. Unfairness in giving—some receive more than they need, others receive less. The scale is unbalanced, justice is absent.
*Keywords:* Manipulation through giving, strings attached, envy, resentment, stinginess, unfair distribution, charity as control, humiliation.

## Esoteric Interpretation

### The Sephirotic Lens: Tiphareth as Harmonious Beauty

**Tiphareth** is the sixth Sephirah, titled **Beauty** (*Tiphareth* in Hebrew). It is the **heart** of the Tree of Life, the center where all paths meet, the harmonizing force that balances mercy (Chesed) and severity (Geburah).

In the Qabalistic framework, Tiphareth represents:
- **Balance**: The equilibrium point between opposing forces
- **Beauty**: Not merely aesthetic beauty, but the *harmony* that arises when all elements are rightly ordered
- **The Heart**: The center of compassion, the place where giving flows naturally
- **The Number Six**: All Sixes in the Tarot express Tiphareth through their respective elements. The Six of Pentacles is Tiphareth-as-Earth—harmony and beauty expressing through material reality.

In the context of the Pentacles suit, Tiphareth teaches: **Success that is beautiful is success that is shared**. The Ace offered the seed; the Two juggled; the Three built; the Four hoarded; the Five lost everything. But the Six? The Six *restores balance*. Resources flow again. The one who has gives to the one who needs. This is the heart's generosity—but note, it is *not* indiscriminate. Tiphareth is *beautiful* because it is *ordered*. The merchant weighs the coins. He gives with discernment.

Tiphareth in Assiah (Material World) is material success that serves a higher purpose. You have wealth—now what will you do with it? If you hoard (Four), you become rigid. If you lose it (Five), you are humbled. But if you *circulate* it (Six), you participate in the divine flow—resources moving from fullness to emptiness, from abundance to need, maintaining the balance.

### The Planetary-Zodiacal Synthesis: Moon in Taurus

The Six of Pentacles is governed by **Moon in Taurus**—a placement that blends emotional intuition with material stability, resulting in *nurturance*, *generosity*, and *sensory abundance*.

**Moon** is the planet of:
- **Cycles**: The ebb and flow, the waxing and waning, the tide that goes out and comes back in
- **Intuition**: The gut feeling, the emotional knowing, the capacity to sense need
- **Nurturance**: The mother, the caregiver, the one who feeds and shelters
- **Emotion**: The feeling realm, the realm of connection and care

**Taurus** is the sign of:
- **Material Stability**: Money, property, resources that can be touched and held
- **Sensory Abundance**: Food, comfort, physical pleasure, the body cared for
- **Accumulation**: The slow, patient gathering of wealth over time
- **Groundedness**: The fixed earth, the foundation that does not shift

When the Moon enters Taurus, emotional nurturance is *grounded in material reality*. This is not abstract compassion; this is *practical help*—food for the hungry, shelter for the homeless, money for those in need. The Moon's capacity to *feel* others' suffering is channeled through Taurus' capacity to *provide* material resources.

In the Six of Pentacles, this synthesis manifests as:
- **Generosity rooted in abundance**: The giver has *enough* to give. This is not sacrifice (giving what you cannot afford); this is *overflow* (sharing from surplus).
- **Intuitive discernment**: The Moon weighs who needs what. This is not bureaucratic charity (everyone gets the same); this is *responsive* giving (each receives according to their need).
- **Cyclical flow**: The Moon teaches that resources *circulate*. Today you give; tomorrow you may receive. The flow goes both ways.
- **Emotional satisfaction in giving**: Taurus is sensory; giving *feels good*. The Six is not grim duty but *pleasure*—the joy of easing another's suffering.

The decan system places this card in the **second decan of Taurus** (May 1-10), the heart of spring abundance. The earth is fertile, the harvest is coming, resources are plentiful. The Six of Pentacles captures this moment of *surplus*—there is enough to share, and so sharing happens naturally.

### The Number Six: Harmony and Balance

The **number six** represents:
- **Harmony**: The resolution of conflict, the equilibrium after struggle
- **Beauty**: The aesthetic principle—rightness, proportion, grace
- **Balance**: The scales even, the forces in equilibrium
- **The Hexagram**: Six points forming a perfect geometric balance (the Star of David, the Seal of Solomon)

All Sixes in the Tarot express this archetypal energy through their respective elements:
- **Six of Wands**: Victory, recognition, success acknowledged (fire)
- **Six of Cups**: Nostalgia, innocence, emotional harmony (water)
- **Six of Swords**: Transition, moving toward calmer waters (air)
- **Six of Pentacles**: Material success, generosity, resources shared (earth)

In the Pentacles suit, the Six manifests as **the restoration of balance through circulation**. The Five was the crisis—resources lost, the figures outside in the cold. The Six is the *resolution*—resources flowing again, the door opened, help given. But note: this is not the *end* of the journey (that is the Ten). This is the *midpoint*, the moment of temporary equilibrium before the journey continues.

The number six also implies *reciprocity*. In sacred geometry, the hexagram is two triangles interlocking—one pointing up (giving), one pointing down (receiving). The Six of Pentacles embodies this: you give, I receive; I give, you receive. The flow is *mutual*, even if in this moment the roles are distinct.

### Rider-Waite Symbolism: A Deep Dive

The Rider-Waite image of the Six of Pentacles is one of the most socially and psychologically complex cards in the Minor Arcana. Let us examine each element:

#### The Merchant: The One Who Gives

A **wealthy merchant** or **lord** stands, dressed in fine **robes** (purple, suggesting royalty or at least prosperity). He holds a **scale** (balance) in his left hand and **coins** in his right hand, which he is distributing to two **kneeling figures** before him.

The **merchant/lord** represents:
- **The position of abundance**: He is not struggling; he has *surplus*. This is giving from fullness, not from scarcity.
- **Authority and power**: His fine robes, his standing posture, his control of the scale—he is clearly in a position of social and economic superiority.
- **The benevolent patron**: He could hoard (like the Four), but he chooses to share. This is generosity, but it is generosity from above.

The **fine robes** suggest:
- **Success**: He has worked, accumulated, succeeded. The Six of Pentacles often appears after the Three (skilled work) and before/instead of the Four (hoarding). He has built wealth and *chosen* to share it.
- **Status**: The robes mark him as different from the beggars. This is not peer-to-peer exchange; this is *charity* (from high to low).
- **Dignity**: He gives with pride, not shame. For him, generosity is an expression of his success, not a burden.

#### The Scale: Justice and Discernment

The merchant holds a **balance scale** in his left hand. The scale has **two pans**, perfectly balanced.

The **scale** represents:
- **Justice**: The merchant does not give blindly. He *weighs*—assesses need, measures fairness, determines who receives how much.
- **Discernment**: Not everyone gets the same. The scale implies *differentiation*—some receive more, some less, according to (the merchant's judgment of) their need.
- **Power**: The one who holds the scale *decides*. The merchant is judge, arbiter, gatekeeper. He controls the flow of resources.

The fact that the scale is **balanced** suggests:
- **Fairness (from the giver's perspective)**: The merchant believes he is giving justly. Each receives what they are due.
- **Equilibrium restored**: The Five was imbalance (some have all, others have nothing). The Six is balance—resources redistributed, the scales even.
- **But whose justice?**: The merchant's sense of fairness may not match the receiver's sense of fairness. The scale is balanced *in his hand*, not in theirs.

#### The Coins: The Material Resources

The merchant distributes **gold coins** from his right hand to the kneeling figures. The coins are tangible, real, immediately useful.

The **coins** represent:
- **Practical help**: Not advice, not pity, not empty words—actual money, actual resources that can be used to meet needs.
- **Finite resources**: The merchant does not have infinite coins. He gives some, but not all. Generosity has limits.
- **The flow of wealth**: The coins that were his are now being transferred to others. Wealth is *circulating*, not static.

#### The Two Kneeling Figures: The Ones Who Receive

Before the merchant, **two figures kneel**, holding out their hands to receive the coins. They are dressed in simple, tattered clothing—clearly poor, clearly in need.

The **kneeling posture** is crucial:
- **Supplication**: The figures are not standing as equals. They are *below*, asking, waiting for the merchant's decision.
- **Gratitude**: Kneeling suggests humility, thankfulness, deference. The figures are grateful for what they receive.
- **Power imbalance**: Charity creates hierarchy. The giver stands; the receiver kneels. This is help, yes—but it is not *empowerment*.

The **two figures** (not one, not three) suggest:
- **Community in need**: They are not alone in their poverty. There are others like them.
- **Scarcity**: The merchant gives to two, but there may be others waiting. Resources are limited; not everyone can be helped.
- **Comparison**: Do both receive the same amount? Or does the merchant *weigh* and give to one more than the other? The scale suggests differentiation.

The **tattered clothing** contrasts with the merchant's fine robes:
- **Inequality**: The gap between rich and poor is visible, stark, undeniable.
- **Dependence**: The figures cannot help themselves; they must rely on the merchant's generosity.
- **Dignity lost**: In some depictions, the figures look grateful; in others, they look ashamed. Receiving charity can wound pride.

#### The Background: The City or Marketplace

Behind the figures, the setting appears to be a **city**, a **marketplace**, or a public square. This is not wilderness; this is civilization, commerce, human society.

The **public setting** suggests:
- **Charity as public act**: The merchant gives *openly*, where others can see. Is this generosity, or is it display? Is he giving to help, or to be seen as generous?
- **The commons**: In medieval tradition, the public square was where justice was enacted, where resources were distributed. The Six happens in the *collective* space, not in private.
- **The market**: This is the world of exchange, of buying and selling. Even charity is part of the economic system.

The landscape as a whole suggests: *Wealth is circulating again. The crisis of the Five is resolving. But note the power dynamics—the giver decides, the receiver kneels. Is this justice, or is this just?*

### Esoteric and Cross-Tradition Parallels

The Six of Pentacles resonates across multiple wisdom traditions:

#### The Widow's Mite: True Generosity

In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus observes people giving money at the temple. The rich give large sums, but a **poor widow** gives two small coins—all she has. Jesus says: "This widow has put more in than all those who are contributing. For they contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had."

The Six of Pentacles asks: *Is the merchant giving out of his abundance (easy), or out of his need (sacrificial)?* The card shows the former—he gives from surplus. True generosity, the widow teaches, is giving what *costs* you, not what you can easily spare. The Six is generous—but it is not the widow's mite.

#### The Parable of the Talents (Again): The Master's Return

In the parable of the talents, the master returns and rewards the servants who *multiplied* what they were given. The servant who buried his talent is condemned—not for losing it, but for failing to *circulate* it, to put it to use, to allow it to grow.

The Six of Pentacles is the master who gives wisely, who ensures that resources are *used*, not hoarded. But it also asks: *Does the giver empower the receiver to multiply what they're given, or does the giver keep the receiver dependent?*

#### Tzedakah: Justice, Not Charity

In Jewish tradition, **tzedakah** (often translated as "charity") literally means "*justice*" or "righteousness." Giving is not optional kindness; it is *obligation*—the recognition that wealth is not purely individual but has a communal dimension. Those who have *must* give to those who need, not out of pity, but out of *justice*.

The Six of Pentacles can be read as tzedakah—giving not from the goodness of the heart, but from the recognition that justice *requires* redistribution. But the card also asks: *Is the scale truly just? Who decides what is fair?*

#### The I Ching Hexagram 42: Increase (Yi)

In the *I Ching*, **Hexagram 42** (益 *Yi*, "Increase") represents *augmentation*, *blessing*, *the upper enriching the lower*. The *Judgment* says: "Increase. It furthers one to undertake something. It furthers one to cross the great water."

The hexagram teaches that when the strong support the weak, *both* benefit—the weak are lifted, and the strong fulfill their purpose. The Six of Pentacles and Hexagram 42 both teach: **Generosity is not loss; it is increase. When wealth circulates, all prosper.**

### Psychological and Jungian Depth

In Jungian psychology, the Six of Pentacles represents **the ego navigating the dynamics of power, abundance, and relationship**—the moment when you must decide how to use the resources (material, psychological, spiritual) you have accumulated.

#### The Giver: The Burden and Gift of Abundance

For those in the position of the merchant—those who *have* resources, whether money, knowledge, skill, or emotional capacity—the Six of Pentacles poses a critical question: **How do I give without creating dependency or reinforcing my ego?**

The shadow of the giver includes:
- **Savior complex**: Using charity to feel important, needed, superior. "I am the one who saves you—you would be lost without me."
- **Control through generosity**: Giving with strings attached, ensuring the receiver remains obligated. "I gave you this—now you owe me."
- **Ego inflation**: Public displays of generosity designed to enhance reputation rather than serve need.
- **Paternalism**: "I know what you need better than you do." The giver decides, the receiver has no say.

The integrated response is:
- **Giving from overflow, not ego**: Sharing because you have surplus, not to prove your worth.
- **Empowerment, not dependency**: Giving in ways that help the receiver become *independent*, not perpetually reliant.
- **Anonymous giving**: Giving without needing recognition, credit, or gratitude.
- **Respecting agency**: Asking what the receiver *needs* rather than assuming you know.

#### The Receiver: The Wound and Wisdom of Need

For those in the position of the kneeling figures—those who *need* help, whether materially or emotionally—the Six of Pentacles poses an equally critical question: **How do I receive without losing dignity or agency?**

The shadow of the receiver includes:
- **Shame**: Feeling humiliated by needing help, internalizing the belief that needing = weakness.
- **Resentment**: Envying the giver's power, feeling angry at the inequality, hating the necessity of kneeling.
- **Dependency**: Learning to stay helpless because it's easier to receive than to work.
- **Entitlement**: Believing that others *owe* you support, that receiving is a right without reciprocity.

The integrated response is:
- **Receiving with grace**: Accepting help without shame, recognizing that all humans need support at times.
- **Gratitude without subservience**: Thanking the giver without losing your dignity or voice.
- **Learning from the gift**: Using what is given to *grow*, to build capacity, to eventually give in return.
- **Recognizing interdependence**: We all give and receive; no one is purely giver or purely receiver.

#### The Central Tension: Hierarchy vs. Mutuality

The deepest psychological (and political) question of the Six of Pentacles is this: **Is charity a band-aid that preserves inequality, or is it the first step toward justice?**

The card shows *charity*—the merchant gives, the beggars receive, but the structure of inequality remains. Tomorrow, the beggars will still be poor; the merchant will still be rich. The Six does not dismantle the system; it *softens* it.

But the card also shows *flow*—resources that were static (hoarded in the Four, lost in the Five) are now *moving* again. The scales balance. And perhaps, in time, the flow itself will erode the hierarchy. The kneeling figures may rise. The merchant may fall. The wheel turns.

The Six teaches: **Do what you can with what you have, where you are**. Charity is not justice—but it is better than hoarding. Giving is not equality—but it is better than withholding. The scales are not yet perfectly balanced—but they are more balanced than they were.

### The Gift of Integration

When the Six of Pentacles is consciously integrated, it offers these gifts:

**Generosity Without Ego**: The capacity to give from genuine care, not from the need to be seen as generous. Giving that serves the receiver, not the giver's self-image.

**Receiving Without Shame**: The humility to accept help when you need it, recognizing that needing is human, not failure. Gratitude that is genuine, not servile.

**Discernment in Giving**: The wisdom to know *when* to give, *how much* to give, *to whom* to give. Not every request is legitimate; not every need should be met by you.

**Awareness of Power Dynamics**: The recognition that giving creates relationship, and relationship involves power. Conscious navigation of hierarchy, working toward mutuality where possible.

**Circulation, Not Accumulation**: The understanding that wealth (material or otherwise) is meant to *flow*, not to be hoarded. You give today; you receive tomorrow. The flow is reciprocal.

### The Central Paradox: Charity as Liberation and Control

The ultimate mystery of the Six of Pentacles is this: **The act of giving can both liberate and bind, depending on how it is done**.

Charity that empowers says: "Here are resources. Use them to build capacity, to become independent, to thrive." It gives and then *steps back*, trusting the receiver to use the gift wisely.

Charity that controls says: "Here are resources. I will decide how you use them, and you will remain obligated to me for as long as I give." It gives and then *holds on*, keeping the receiver dependent.

The Six asks: **Which merchant are you? And if you are the kneeling figure—do you recognize when charity is true help, and when it is a chain?**

The invitation is to give freely and receive gratefully, to recognize interdependence, and to work toward a world where no one needs to kneel—because we all stand together, giving and receiving as equals.
