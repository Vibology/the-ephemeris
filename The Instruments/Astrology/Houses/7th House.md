# 7th House
*Partnership and the Mirror of Relationship*

---

## Archetypal Theme

The **7th House** is the **Descendant** (DSC)—the western horizon, the point where the Sun sets. This is the house of **partnership**: marriage, committed relationships, contracts, and all formal bonds that require two selves to negotiate as equals. It is **Libra's domain**: the quest for balance through the other.

Where the 1st House (Ascendant) is "I am," the 7th House is **"We are"**—the transformation of solo identity into relational identity. But the 7th House is not fusion; it is **mirror**. What you see in the other is often what you cannot see in yourself.

Lilly describes the 7th House as governing "marriage, the wife or husband, public enemies, lawsuits, quarrels, thieves, and fugitives."[^1]
