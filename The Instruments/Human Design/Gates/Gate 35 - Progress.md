# Gate 35: Progress (Change)

## Ra's Definition
According to Ra Uru Hu, Gate 35 is located in the Throat Center and represents **the voice of experience and change**—the capacity to articulate "I feel" through the lens of lived experience, the hunger for new experience, and the recognition that progress requires movement through emotional territory.

Ra taught that Gate 35 operates within the **Collective Abstract/Sensing Circuit**, which means it carries the energy of **experiential learning**—the wisdom that emerges only through living, feeling, and reflecting on the emotional journey. This is not logical analysis or individual mutation—it is collective evolution through shared experience.

**"Gate 35 is hunger for experience. It says 'I feel' because it must taste life to know it. Without Gate 36, this hunger has no emotional depth—just craving without crisis."** — Ra Uru Hu[^1]

The keynote here is **hunger as spiritual necessity**—the need for new experience is not greed but the evolutionary impulse toward growth through change.

## I-Ching Hexagram Analysis

Hexagram 35, **晉 (Jìn) - Progress / Advancement**, is composed of Fire above (☲ Li, the Clinging) over Earth below (☷ Kun, the Receptive)—the image of the sun rising over the earth, dawn breaking, light advancing from darkness.

**Judgment (Wilhelm/Baynes):**
> "Progress. The powerful prince is honored with horses in large numbers. In a single day he is granted audience three times."

The hexagram speaks to **advancement through alignment with natural cycles**—progress is not forced but emerges when one moves with the rising light, with collective momentum, with the tide of change.

**Image:**
> "The sun rises over the earth: The image of Progress. Thus the superior man himself brightens his bright virtue."

This is the essence of Gate 35: **progress through self-illumination and experience**. The light does not force its way—it simply rises, and in rising, illuminates what was dark.

In Human Design terms, this hexagram's placement in the **Throat Center** transforms philosophical progress into **vocalized experience**. The question becomes: "What new experience am I hungry for, and how do I articulate that journey?"

## Line-by-Line Breakdown

### Line 1: Humility
**Exalted (Moon):** Humble approach to new experience, receptivity to learning without arrogance.
**Detriment (Sun):** Arrogance in seeking experience, believing one already knows what has not been lived.

This line reveals that progress requires **humility**—approaching new experience as a student, not an expert. The shadow is seeking change for ego rather than growth.

### Line 2: Creative Block
**Exalted (Saturn):** Disciplined patience when experience is not available, waiting for the right timing.
**Detriment (Neptune):** Feeling blocked and despairing, unable to wait for experience to arrive.

The second line names the frustration: **creative block**. Gate 35's hunger can feel blocked when new experience is not immediately available. The gift is trusting the timing.

### Line 3: Collaboration
**Exalted (Mars):** Seeking new experience through collaborative engagement, learning with others.
**Detriment (Jupiter):** Attempting progress alone, refusing collaboration, missing shared wisdom.

Line 3 is the trial-and-error foundation. This individual discovers through experiment that progress often requires **collaboration**—shared experience amplifies learning.

### Line 4: Hunger
**Exalted (Jupiter):** Healthy hunger for growth, expansion, and evolution through new experience.
**Detriment (Venus):** Insatiable hunger, craving experience addictively, never satisfied.

The fourth line transpersonal shift: **hunger** is named directly. Is this hunger for growth, or addiction to novelty? This line learns to discern spiritual hunger from compulsion.

### Line 5: Altruism
**Exalted (Mercury):** Seeking experience to serve others, progress motivated by collective benefit.
**Detriment (Pluto):** Using others as vehicles for one's own experience, exploitation disguised as altruism.

Line 5 is the heretic/savior dynamic applied to progress. The individual carries a projection—others expect them to seek change altruistically. The gift is genuine service; the shadow is using "progress" as manipulation.

### Line 6: Rectification
**Exalted (Venus):** Correcting course based on experience, learning from mistakes, adaptive progress.
**Detriment (Mercury):** Repeating patterns without learning, failing to rectify errors.

The sixth line culminates in **rectification**—the wisdom to adjust based on lived experience. After trials of lines 1-5, the individual knows how to course-correct.

## Circuitry Analysis

Gate 35 belongs to the **Collective Abstract/Sensing Circuit**, characterized by:

- **Experience Over Time:** Learning through emotional wave and lived experience
- **Storytelling:** Processing experience into narrative wisdom
- **Emotional Maturity:** Waiting through peaks and valleys for clarity
- **Universal Themes:** Extracting collective lessons from personal journey

**The Role of Gate 35 in the Circuit:**

Gate 35 is the **voice of experiential hunger**—articulating the need for change, new experience, and the lessons learned through the journey. This is the traveler, the adventurer, the one who says: "I must experience this to know it."

**Why Abstract Requires Experience:**

The Abstract Circuit cannot learn through logic or theory—it must **feel, live, and reflect**. Gate 35's hunger is mechanically necessary for growth. Without new experience, the circuit stagnates.

## Channel Formation

Gate 35 forms **Channel 35-36: Transitoriness** when connected to Gate 36 in the Solar Plexus.

#### Electromagnetic Function

- **Gate 35 (Throat):** "I articulate my hunger for new experience."
- **Gate 36 (Solar Plexus):** "I feel the crisis, the emotional depth of experience."
- **Channel 35-36:** The bridge between experiential hunger (Throat) and emotional crisis (Solar Plexus).

When this channel is defined, the individual has **consistent access to experiential learning through emotional crisis**. They are designed to hunger for new experience and feel it deeply through the emotional wave. This is the channel of the **jack-of-all-trades**—tasting everything, learning from crisis, never settling.

**Without the channel defined** (only Gate 35 activated), the individual experiences **hunger for change** but may lack the emotional depth or crisis that transforms experience into wisdom. They need someone with Gate 36 to complete the circuit.

#### Interpersonal Electromagnetic Dynamics

- **Both have Channel 35-36:** Mutual hunger for experience, potential for shared adventure or crisis addiction.
- **One has Gate 35, other has Gate 36:** The Gate 35 person articulates hunger; the Gate 36 person provides emotional depth. This can be intense and transformative.
- **Neither has this channel:** The hunger-crisis dynamic remains latent.

## Biological and Somatic Dimension

Gate 35 is located in the **Throat Center**, which corresponds biologically to the **thyroid, parathyroid, larynx, and vocal cords**. The Throat is the center of **manifestation**—and for Gate 35, manifestation takes the form of **expressing the need for experience**.

#### Physiological Signature

Individuals with Gate 35 defined may experience:
- A deep **somatic restlessness** when new experience is not available—the body craves change
- **Throat activation** when expressing hunger or sharing experiential stories
- **Thyroid sensitivity** if hunger is chronically unfulfilled (metabolic imbalance from stagnation)

#### Energetic Signature

The Throat Center radiates **manifestation energy**. When Gate 35 is active, the aura carries a frequency that says: "I need new experience. I am hungry for change." Others may feel this as **adventurous**, **restless**, or (if in Not-Self) **addicted to novelty**.

**Defined vs. Undefined in Gate 35:**

- **Defined Gate 35:** Consistent hunger for new experience. The individual knows they are here to seek change and learn through living.
- **Undefined/Open Gate 35:** Samples hunger from others. Vulnerable to conditioning around "needing to experience everything" or "being adventurous."

## Strategy Integration
Gate 35, being in the Throat Center connected to the Solar Plexus via Channel 35-36, is often linked to **Emotional Authority** when that channel is defined.

**For Generators/Manifesting Generators with Gate 35:**

The hunger for experience must still wait for Sacral response. The Gate 35 energy says "I want to try this!" but the Sacral must confirm whether *this particular experience* is correct.

**For Projectors with Gate 35:**

The experiential wisdom is clear, but the Projector must wait for invitation before sharing stories or seeking shared experience. Uninvited hunger ("Let's do this together!") can lead to bitterness.

**For Manifestors with Gate 35:**

The hunger can be initiated, but the Manifestor must **inform** before pursuing new experience, especially if it impacts others.

**For Reflectors with Gate 35:**

The hunger is inconsistent (activated by transits or others). The Reflector must wait the full lunar cycle before committing to major experiential changes.

**For those with Emotional Authority and Gate 35:**

Experience must be evaluated through the emotional wave. Wait through the peaks and valleys before committing to change.

## Not-Self Patterns
**Shadow Expressions of Gate 35:**

- **Hunger** (Gene Keys Shadow): Insatiable craving for experience, addiction to novelty, never satisfied.
- **Restless Boredom:** Inability to be present, always seeking the next thing.
- **Experience Hoarding:** Collecting experiences like trophies without integrating the lessons.
- **Altruism as Manipulation:** Using "progress" or "growth" to exploit others.
- **Creative Block Despair:** Feeling trapped when new experience is not immediately available.

#### Not-Self Indicators

- Constantly seeking novelty without satisfaction
- Feeling bored or stuck when life is stable
- Pursuing experience compulsively to avoid inner emptiness
- Burnout from over-committing to new experiences

**Conditioning Patterns for Undefined Gate 35:**

Those without Gate 35 may be conditioned to believe:
- "I must always be seeking new experiences."
- "If I'm not progressing, I'm failing."
- "Stability is stagnation."

This conditioning leads to forcing change or adventure when it is not needed.

## Deconditioning Process

The **7-year deconditioning cycle** for Gate 35 involves learning to recognize when hunger for experience is authentic (mechanically necessary for growth) versus conditioned (addiction to novelty, avoidance of stability).

**Year 1-2:** Awareness phase—noticing when hunger feels aligned versus compulsive.

**Year 3-4:** Experimentation phase—trying different levels of change and stability while observing what serves.

**Year 5-6:** Refinement phase—trusting the timing of new experience, honoring stability when appropriate.

**Year 7:** Integration phase—hunger becomes **adventure** (Gene Keys Gift) rather than compulsion. The individual seeks experience to grow, not to escape.

#### Somatic Practice

- Notice where hunger arises in the body. Is it the throat (Gate 35)? The gut (Sacral)? The solar plexus (emotion)? Or absorbed from others?
- Practice **waiting for invitation or response** before pursuing new experience.
- Release the need to "always be progressing" and instead ask: "What experience serves my evolution?"

## Cross-System Synthesis

### I-Ching: Hexagram 35 - Progress

The I-Ching's Hexagram 35 represents **advancement like the rising sun**—Fire over Earth, light emerging from darkness. In the Book of Changes, this hexagram counsels **moving with natural momentum**, not forcing progress.

In Human Design, this philosophical progress is **transformed into experiential hunger**—the need to taste, feel, and live in order to grow.

### Gene Keys: Shadow → Gift → Siddhi

Richard Rudd's Gene Keys framework provides a shadow-gift-siddhi progression for Gate 35:

- **Shadow: Hunger** — Insatiable craving, addiction to experience, never satisfied.
- **Gift: Adventure** — Healthy hunger for growth, seeking experience as spiritual practice.
- **Siddhi: Boundlessness** — The recognition that all experience is the Divine tasting itself. Hunger dissolves into infinite presence.

The progression from Hunger to Boundlessness is the journey of Gate 35: from craving to sacred adventure to infinite being.

### Astrology: Jupiter and Sagittarius (If Applicable)

Gate 35 resonates with **Jupiter** (expansion, growth, adventure) and **Sagittarius** (the seeker, the explorer, the philosopher-adventurer).

### Tarot: The Hermit (Canonical Correspondence - Ra Uru Hu)

According to Ra Uru Hu's teaching documented by Eleanor Haspel-Portner (2003), Gate 35 corresponds to **The Hermit** (Atu IX / Key 9) in the Major Arcana. This is not thematic resonance but canonical correspondence from Ra's 1998 transmission.

**The Hermit's essence:** Solitary seeking, the lantern of inner wisdom gained through withdrawal and experience. The sage who has journeyed alone and brings light from that journey.

**Gate 35's mechanics:** Progress—the hunger for new experience, the voice that says "I feel" through lived emotional journey. The Throat gate that articulates experiential wisdom within the Collective Sensing Circuit.

**Convergence:** Gate 35's hunger for experience requires The Hermit's **solitary journey**. Progress is not group movement but **individual adventure** that enriches the collective. The Hermit withdraws to climb the mountain alone, then brings the light back; Gate 35 seeks new experience independently, then shares what was felt and learned. Both teach that **authentic progress requires solo journey**—the wisdom to pursue experience alone before sharing its lessons. Channel 35-36 (Transitoriness) embodies The Hermit's transient path—moving through emotional landscapes to gather experiential knowing.

### Qabalah: Chokmah (Wisdom)

Gate 35 resonates with **Chokmah** (Wisdom)—the second Sephirah, representing the first impulse of manifestation, the hunger for experience, the exploration of infinite possibility.

## Jungian and Psychological Dimension

In Jungian terms, Gate 35 corresponds to the **Explorer Archetype** and the psychological drive toward **growth through experience**.

**Archetypal Theme: The Adventurer**

The Adventurer seeks growth through lived experience, learning through journey, evolving through change.

#### Shadow Work Implications

The **Shadow of Gate 35** manifests as:
- **Addiction to Novelty:** Using experience to avoid depth or commitment.
- **Restlessness as Pathology:** Unable to be present, always seeking the next thing.
- **Experience as Escape:** Pursuing change to avoid inner work.

#### Individuation Path

For the individual with Gate 35, individuation requires:
1. **Separation from Compulsive Seeking:** Recognizing when hunger is growth versus avoidance.
2. **Integration of Stability:** Learning that depth sometimes requires staying, not leaving.
3. **Sacred Adventure:** Transforming experience-seeking into spiritual practice.

When integrated, Gate 35 becomes the expression of **Boundlessness**—tasting life as the Divine explores itself.

## The Gift of Correctness

When the individual with Gate 35 operates according to their Strategy and Authority, the gift that emerges is **Adventure** (Gene Keys) and **Evolutionary Experience** (Human Design).

#### What This Looks Like

- Hunger becomes **sacred**—seeking experience to grow, not to escape.
- Change is **aligned**—pursued when correct, not compulsively.
- Experience is **integrated**—lessons learned, not just accumulated.
- The individual trusts **timing**—knowing when to seek and when to stabilize.
- Hunger dissolves into **boundlessness**—all experience is sacred.

**The Signature of Gate 35:**

The Signature of the Throat Center is **manifestation and peace**. For Gate 35 specifically, this manifests as:
- Seeking experience that serves evolution
- Sharing stories that enrich collective understanding
- Trusting the timing of change

#### The Contribution to Living One's Design

Gate 35 teaches that **progress requires movement**. When the individual honors their hunger for aligned experience, they become a **living example** of evolutionary growth through adventure.
