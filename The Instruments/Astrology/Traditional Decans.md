# Traditional Decans

*The Thirty-Six Faces of the Zodiac*

## Archetypal Essence

The **decans** — from the Greek *dekanos* ("ten") — divide each zodiacal sign into three segments of 10°, yielding thirty-six faces across the complete circle. They are the most granular subdivision of the zodiac used systematically in traditional astrology, and the **face** (*prosōpon*) constitutes the fifth and weakest level of [[Planetary Condition|Dignities & Rulerships]][^1].

If the domicile ruler is the *king*, the exaltation ruler the *honored guest*, the triplicity ruler the *ally*, and the bound lord the *local magistrate*, then the face ruler is the *stranger recognized by appearance* — a planet that possesses no deep authority in the territory but is at least *known*, not entirely foreign. The face provides the barest foothold of dignity, enough to prevent a planet from being **peregrine** — the condition of having no dignities at all, of being a wanderer without jurisdiction or recognition in any system[^1].

The word *prosōpon* means "face" or "countenance" — the visible surface, the guise a planet wears in that particular segment of the zodiac. Where domicile reveals character, exaltation reveals honor, triplicity reveals alliance, and bounds reveal local conditions, the face reveals *appearance* — the outermost layer of how a planet presents itself.

## Historical Origins

### Egyptian Decans (c. 2100 BCE)

The decans originated in Egypt around 2100 BCE as a system of **thirty-six asterisms** — specific stars or star groups used for timekeeping. Each decan rose heliacally (at dawn) for approximately ten days before being replaced by the next, providing a method of measuring the hours of the night and tracking the passage of the year. These were not zodiacal subdivisions but independent star-markers, each associated with specific deities and images[^2].

The names and images of the Egyptian decans survive in temple ceilings, coffin lids, and astronomical texts. They were living presences — divine powers that governed specific periods of time and specific regions of the sky, not abstract degree divisions.

### Hellenistic Synthesis (c. 1st Century BCE)

When the Mesopotamian zodiac reached Egypt during the Hellenistic period, a fusion occurred: the thirty-six Egyptian timekeeping asterisms were mapped onto the twelve signs of the 360° zodiac, yielding three decans per sign of 10° each. This marriage of Egyptian stellar religion with Babylonian mathematical astronomy produced the decan system used throughout the Hellenistic, medieval, and Renaissance traditions[^3].

The images and deities of the Egyptian decans were preserved and transformed — Hellenistic texts like the *Liber Hermetis* describe specific figures associated with each decan (a man with a battle-axe, a woman with a scepter, etc.), which became the foundation for the talismanic and image-magic traditions of the medieval period[^4].

## The Chaldean Faces (Standard Dignity System)

The primary system used for dignity assessment assigns face rulers according to the **Chaldean order** — the descending sequence of planetary speed as seen from Earth: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. This sequence repeats endlessly.

The cycle begins with **Mars** ruling the first face of Aries (the first sign), then proceeds through Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun... without interruption through all thirty-six faces. The sequence completes a full circuit: the third face of Pisces (Mars) connects directly back to the first face of Aries (Mars), closing the wheel[^5].

### Complete Chaldean Face Table

| Sign | 1st Face (0°–10°) | 2nd Face (10°–20°) | 3rd Face (20°–30°) |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Aries** | Mars | Sun | Venus |
| **Taurus** | Mercury | Moon | Saturn |
| **Gemini** | Jupiter | Mars | Sun |
| **Cancer** | Venus | Mercury | Moon |
| **Leo** | Saturn | Jupiter | Mars |
| **Virgo** | Sun | Venus | Mercury |
| **Libra** | Moon | Saturn | Jupiter |
| **Scorpio** | Mars | Sun | Venus |
| **Sagittarius** | Mercury | Moon | Saturn |
| **Capricorn** | Jupiter | Mars | Sun |
| **Aquarius** | Venus | Mercury | Moon |
| **Pisces** | Saturn | Jupiter | Mars |

### Structural Observations

- **Mars opens and closes the cycle.** The first face of Aries and the last face of Pisces are both ruled by Mars — the initiator and the completor. The zodiac begins and ends with the warrior's blade.
- **Opposite signs share the same face rulers.** Aries (Mars, Sun, Venus) and Scorpio (Mars, Sun, Venus); Taurus (Mercury, Moon, Saturn) and Sagittarius (Mercury, Moon, Saturn); and so on. Every sign shares its face sequence with the sign opposite on the wheel — a hidden symmetry of polarity.
- **Each planet rules exactly five faces** across the wheel (with Mars ruling six — opening Aries and closing Pisces). The distribution is nearly equal, with the martial principle carrying an extra face.
- **The domicile ruler does not necessarily rule a face in its own sign.** Venus rules no face in Taurus or Libra. The Sun rules no face in Leo. This is precisely why the face is the *weakest* dignity — it follows its own mathematical logic (the Chaldean sequence) independent of the sign's inherent nature.

## The Triplicity-Based Decans (Alternative System)

A second system assigns decan rulers based on the **elemental triplicity**: the three signs sharing an element. The first decan is ruled by the sign's own ruler, the second by the ruler of the next sign in the same element, and the third by the ruler of the remaining sign of that element.

### Triplicity Decan Rulers

| Element | 1st Decan | 2nd Decan | 3rd Decan |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Fire** (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) | Mars, Sun, Jupiter | Sun, Jupiter, Mars | Jupiter, Mars, Sun |
| **Earth** (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) | Venus, Mercury, Saturn | Mercury, Saturn, Venus | Saturn, Venus, Mercury |
| **Air** (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) | Mercury, Venus, Saturn | Venus, Saturn, Mercury | Saturn, Mercury, Venus |
| **Water** (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) | Moon, Mars, Jupiter | Mars, Jupiter, Moon | Jupiter, Moon, Mars |

This system, sometimes called the *triplicity decan* or *Drekkana* system (from the Indian tradition, where it originated), has the virtue of connecting each decan to a sign of the same element, maintaining elemental coherence throughout. Its weakness is that it was **not used for dignity assessment** in the Hellenistic tradition — it is a separate framework with different applications, primarily in Indian astrology and some modern Western practice[^6].

**Where the systems diverge:** The Chaldean and triplicity systems often agree on the first decan (when the sign ruler happens to fall in the Chaldean sequence at that position) but frequently diverge on the second and third. For example, the third face of Aries is **Venus** in the Chaldean system but **Jupiter** in the triplicity system — a meaningful difference when assessing dignity or interpreting the character of that degree range.

## The Face in Dignity Assessment

### The Fifth Level

The hierarchy of essential dignity, from strongest to weakest:

| Level | Dignity | Metaphor | Practical Weight |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 1st | **Domicile** | King in his kingdom | Full authority |
| 2nd | **Exaltation** | Honored guest at court | Strong elevation |
| 3rd | **Triplicity** | Ally by element and sect | Moderate support |
| 4th | **[[Terms and Bounds\|Bounds]]** | Local magistrate | Minor but meaningful |
| 5th | **Face** | Stranger recognized by appearance | Bare minimum |

Brennan describes the face as a "quasi-dignity" — it provides some minimal support, but its primary function is **negative**: it saves a planet from peregrination. A planet with no domicile, exaltation, triplicity, or bounds dignity but in its own face is not entirely resourceless — it has at least its *appearance*, its *countenance*, even if it has no deeper authority[^1].

### Peregrination

A planet is **peregrine** when it holds no essential dignity whatsoever at its current degree — not in its own domicile, exaltation, triplicity, bounds, *or* face. The peregrine planet is a foreigner with no papers, no connections, no recognition. William Lilly describes the peregrine planet as one that "wanders" without purpose — not debilitated (which is active hostility from the territory) but simply *unrecognized*, operating without institutional support of any kind[^7].

The face prevents this condition. Even at its weakest, it provides a name, a face, a minimal identity within the territory.

### Using Faces in Chart Reading

1. **Check for peregrination** — If a planet has no other dignities at its degree, check whether it occupies its own face. If so, it holds the barest essential dignity.
2. **Do not overweight the face** — A planet "dignified" only by face is still functionally weak. The face does not rescue a planet the way domicile or exaltation does. It merely prevents the condition of absolute foreignness.
3. **Note face rulers for flavor** — Even when not assessing dignity, the face ruler adds a subtle coloring to the degree. A planet at 25° Leo (Mars's face) carries a different surface texture than a planet at 5° Leo (Saturn's face), even though both are in Leo. The face is the outermost modulation — the *appearance* of the archetypal expression at that specific degree.

## The Face and Physical Appearance (Morphē)

The most distinctive practical application of the decans in Hellenistic astrology was **describing the physical appearance and bodily constitution** of the native. Hephaestio of Thebes preserves detailed delineations for each of the thirty-six decans as they rise on the Ascendant — specific descriptions of build, complexion, features, and temperament associated with each 10° segment[^8].

This tradition treated the decan as literally the *face* — the visible form. The rising decan at the moment of birth was understood to stamp the body with a particular physical signature, more specific than the sign alone. Where the Ascendant sign gives the general physical type, the specific decan gives the particular variation — the difference between a lean, sharp-featured Aries rising (Mars's face, 0°–10°) and a softer, more graceful Aries rising (Venus's face, 20°–30°).

This approach is largely lost in modern practice but represents one of the oldest continuous applications of the decan system, linking the astronomical subdivision directly to the embodied, visible world.

## Psychological Depth

The face reveals the **surface presentation** of the archetype — not its essence (domicile), not its aspiration (exaltation), not its elemental alliance (triplicity), not its local conditions (bounds), but its *appearance*, its *persona* in the Jungian sense.

Jung's [[The Persona]] is the mask the ego presents to the world — the social face, the adaptive surface. The face dignity functions analogously: it is the outermost layer of planetary identity, the way the archetype *appears to others* at a particular degree. A planet in its own face has at least its own mask — it appears as itself, even if it has no deeper authority. A planet without even this dignity is *faceless* — unrecognizable, unable to present a coherent identity to the world.

The Chaldean sequence's independence from sign rulership is itself psychologically significant. The face does not follow the logic of belonging (domicile) or honor (exaltation) or kinship (triplicity) or local governance (bounds). It follows its own mathematical logic — the Chaldean planetary order cycling relentlessly through the zodiac regardless of which sign it traverses. This is the archetype of *surface pattern* — consistent, impersonal, indifferent to the deeper meanings of the territory it crosses. The persona does not care about the Self's intentions; it follows its own rhythm.

**Malefics in the faces of signs they do not rule** carry a particular weight. Saturn ruling the first face of Leo (0°–10°) places the principle of limitation, age, and severity at the opening of the Sun's sign — the mask of restriction worn at the very threshold of self-expression. Mars ruling the third face of Leo (20°–30°) places the warrior at the conclusion of the Sun's territory — the aggressive surface appearing as the solar archetype reaches its final degrees. These are the shadow's masks, worn in the territory of light.

## Shadow Expression

- **Reducing faces to point-scoring.** Adding "+1" for face dignity on a tally sheet without understanding what the face *does* — which is almost nothing beyond preventing peregrination. The face is not a bonus; it is a bare minimum.
- **Confusing the two decan systems.** The Chaldean faces (used for dignity) and the triplicity-based decans (used for elemental analysis) are different systems with different logic. Using triplicity decan rulers in dignity calculations produces incorrect results.
- **Projecting too much meaning onto face rulers.** The face is the *weakest* dignity. Over-interpreting the face ruler as a major significator inflates what is meant to be the outermost, thinnest layer of planetary identity.
- **Ignoring the morphē tradition.** Dismissing the face-as-physical-appearance tradition as primitive misses one of the oldest continuous applications of the decan system — the link between celestial subdivision and embodied form.
- **Treating the Egyptian decan images as zodiacal.** The original Egyptian decans were independent asterisms with their own mythological identities. Mapping them onto the zodiac was a Hellenistic innovation, not an inherent feature of the system. The images preserved in texts like *Liber Hermetis* are remnants of the pre-zodiacal tradition, not expressions of sign-based symbolism.
