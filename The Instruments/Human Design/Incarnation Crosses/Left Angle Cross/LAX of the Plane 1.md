# Left Angle Cross of the Plane (1)

## Gates: 36/6/10/15 | Quarter of Initiation

### Ra's Keynote
> "Witnesses of the mundane plane who see the vagaries of humanity (good/bad/ugly), yet have the potential to show us something more: light, spirit, awakening, and enlightenment."[^1]

## The Four Gates

### Personality Sun: Gate 36 - Darkening of the Light (Crisis)
**Center:** Solar Plexus | **Circuitry:** Collective (Sensing/Abstract Circuit)

Gate 36 is the **emotional crisis as gateway to wisdom**—the capacity to feel deeply through the darkening, to experience the valley of the emotional wave. As the Personality Sun, this defines the conscious purpose: to be one who has seen the dark, who knows the depths of human experience. In this Left Angle Cross, this witnessing of darkness becomes the foundation for revealing light.

### Personality Earth: Gate 6 - Conflict (Friction)
**Center:** Solar Plexus | **Circuitry:** Tribal (Defense Circuit)

Gate 6 grounds the emotional crisis with **the law that growth cannot exist without friction**—the diaphragm that regulates intimacy through emotional honesty. The Earth position reveals that witnessing the plane requires navigating conflict, maintaining boundaries, and knowing when to open and when to close.

### Design Sun: Gate 10 - Treading (Behavior of the Self)
**Center:** G (Identity) | **Circuitry:** Integration / Centering

Gate 10 operates unconsciously as **the underlying code of behavior**—the natural way one moves through the world rooted in self-love. This provides the trans-personal destiny with its expression: authentic behavior that models what is possible when one loves oneself enough to be genuine.

### Design Earth: Gate 15 - Modesty (Extremes)
**Center:** G (Identity) | **Circuitry:** Collective (Logic Circuit)

Gate 15 grounds the authentic behavior with **love of humanity through the balancing of extremes**—the capacity to experience and embody the full spectrum of human behavior. This unconscious resource ensures that the witness of the plane is not separate from humanity but deeply immersed in it.

## Cross Theme

The **LAX of the Plane (1)** in the Quarter of Initiation carries the archetype of the **awakened witness**—one whose trans-personal karma involves seeing both the crisis (36) and the friction (6) of the mundane plane, while embodying authentic behavior (10) and love of humanity's extremes (15).

This is a **Left Angle Cross**, meaning the individual carries a **trans-personal destiny**—their life path is fundamentally intertwined with others in karmic ways. The Plane archetype does not merely observe; they transform observation into awakening, showing others that the mundane contains the seeds of the sacred.

**Profiles:** 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3—all carrying the projective quality of the 5th line or the role-model potential of the 6th line.

This cross bridges three streams:
- **Collective Abstract** (36): The experiential wisdom gained through emotional crisis
- **Tribal Defense** (6): The friction and intimacy of human relating
- **Integration / Collective Logic** (10/15): The authentic self expressing love of humanity

In the Quarter of Initiation (Mind), the Plane uses mental faculties to:
- Understand the patterns of human crisis and resolution
- Perceive the purpose within the friction of existence
- Recognize authentic behavior from conditioned performance
- Comprehend the full spectrum of human extremes

## Quarter Context

**Quarter of Initiation | Realm of Alcyone | Purpose through Mind**

In this quarter, the Plane fulfills its trans-personal purpose through **mental comprehension of the mundane that reveals the sacred**. The emotional depths (Gates 36/6) provide the raw material of witnessing, while the G Center gates (10/15) provide the identity through which light can be shown.

Ra's keynote speaks of "the vagaries of humanity (good/bad/ugly)"—this cross has seen it all. The crisis and the conflict, the beauty and the horror. Yet the Quarter of Mind ensures that this witnessing is not mere accumulation of experience but mental processing that reveals pattern, purpose, and potential for awakening.

"Light, spirit, awakening, and enlightenment" are not separate from the plane but hidden within it—and the witness of the Plane can show others where to look.

## Shadow Expression

- **Crisis addiction:** Gate 36's emotional depth becoming identification with suffering, seeking darkness rather than learning from it
- **Chronic conflict:** Gate 6's friction becoming continuous battle rather than the diaphragm of healthy intimacy
- **Behavioral inauthenticity:** Gate 10's self-love collapsing into self-obsession or performance
- **Extremes as chaos:** Gate 15's capacity to hold the spectrum becoming chaotic swinging rather than magnetic balance
- **Spiritual superiority:** The witness using their awareness to separate from rather than illuminate humanity

---

## Highest Expression

- **Crisis as teacher:** Gate 36's darkening of the light becoming the very path through which compassion is forged
- **Sacred friction:** Gate 6's emotional honesty deepening intimacy and modeling authentic relating
- **Authentic presence:** Gate 10's behavior as living demonstration of self-love without narcissism
- **Magnetic humanity:** Gate 15's embrace of extremes creating space for all people to feel accepted
- **Enlightened ordinariness:** Showing that the mundane plane is not obstacle to awakening but the very material of it
