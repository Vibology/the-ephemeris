# Aspects
*The Geometry of Relationship*

## What Are Aspects?

**Aspects** are angular relationships between planets in the natal chart or by transit. They reveal how planetary archetypes *interact*—whether they reinforce, challenge, or integrate one another. Aspects are not "good" or "bad" but **dynamic**: some create flow, others create friction, and friction is often the catalyst for growth.

## The Five Major Aspects

Lilly describes five primary configurations used in judgment: conjunction, sextile, square, trine, and opposition.[^1]

### ☌ Conjunction (0°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Unity, fusion, blending of significations.

**Traditional Teaching:** The conjunction (Hellenistic: *copresence* or *synod*) occurs when planets occupy the same zodiacal sign.[^1][^8] This is not a geometric aspect in the strict sense but a **blending** of planetary significations—like two people living in the same room.[^8] The nature of the conjunction depends entirely on the planets involved: it is not inherently good or bad but **intensifies the relationship**.[^8]

A planet is **bonified** (improved) when copresent with benefics (Venus, Jupiter) but **maltreated** when copresent with malefics (Mars, Saturn).[^8] Lilly writes that conjunction "is good with good planets and evil with evil planets."[^1]

**Hellenistic Orb:** Sign-based primarily; degree-based perfection within 3° of exact conjunction.[^9]

**Example:** Valens describes Jupiter and Mercury copresent as making "supervisory, overseers of affairs, in posts of trust" and "approachable people with many friends"—the significations blend harmoniously.[^8]

**Psychological Synthesis:** The conjunction is the **fusion of archetypes**—two planetary principles become inseparable in expression. Sun-Saturn is authority internalized; Venus-Mars is desire and attraction unified.

### ⚹ Sextile (60°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Gentle harmony, sympathetic cooperation.

**Traditional Teaching:** The sextile (Hellenistic: *hexagon*) connects planets 60° apart (three signs inclusive, e.g., Aries to Gemini).[^1][^8] It is **of the nature of Venus** and is considered harmonious, sympathetic, and beneficial—though weaker than the trine.[^8]

Malefics in sextile are "less harmful" or "incapable of doing harm"; benefics are positive but less efficacious than in trine.[^8] Lilly calls it "imperfect love."[^5]

**Hellenistic Orb:** Sign-based (any planet in a sextile sign "sees" the other); degree-based perfection within 3° of exact 60°.[^9]

**Example:** Valens notes Venus sextile Saturn is positive but "dim and weak," producing mixed marriages or relationships lacking intensity compared to the trine's strength.[^8]

**Psychological Synthesis:** The sextile is **easy integration**—the planets cooperate without friction but also without deep transformation. It provides resources, opportunities, or talents that come naturally but may be underutilized without conscious effort.

---

### □ Square (90°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Tension, struggle, dynamic friction.

**Traditional Teaching:** The square (Hellenistic: *tetragon*) connects planets 90° apart (four signs inclusive, e.g., Aries to Cancer).[^1][^8] It is **of the nature of Mars** and is considered "hard," "inharmonious," and discordant—signifying struggle, intensity, and force.[^8]

This is Mars's special aspect. Interpretation relies heavily on **overcoming** (domination): a planet earlier in zodiacal order (to the "right") dominates the planet to the "left." A malefic overcoming is very harmful; a benefic overcoming mitigates evil.[^8] Lilly calls it "imperfect enmity."[^4]

**Hellenistic Orb:** Sign-based; degree-based perfection within 3° of exact 90°.[^9]

**Example:** Mars square Jupiter—if Jupiter is in superior (overcoming) position, it indicates "great fame, good reputation, and high position." If Mars overcomes Jupiter, it causes "extreme mental anxiety," errors, and hostility.[^8]

**Psychological Synthesis:** The square is the **forge of individuation**—two planetary principles clash, creating internal friction that demands resolution. This is [[The Shadow]] made visible: the square forces consciousness of what we avoid. Mars square Saturn is drive versus limit; Moon square Uranus is security versus freedom.

### △ Trine (120°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Flowing harmony, effortless support.

**Traditional Teaching:** The trine (Hellenistic: *triangle*) connects planets 120° apart (five signs inclusive, e.g., Aries to Leo).[^1][^8] It is **of the nature of Jupiter** and is the most powerful benefic aspect—signifying stability, harmony, and sympathy.[^8]

Even if a malefic is involved, the trine makes it "less damaging." This is the primary aspect for **bonification** (improvement) by benefics.[^8] Lilly calls it "perfect love, unity, and friendship."[^3]

**Hellenistic Orb:** Sign-based; degree-based perfection within 3° of exact 120°.[^9]

**Example:** Jupiter trine Mars—Valens states that if one rules the nativity, this indicates "great men, leaders, and dictators," particularly when in advantageous signs.[^8]

**Psychological Synthesis:** The trine is **grace**—the planets flow together without effort. This is talent, ease, natural gifts. But the shadow of the trine is **complacency**: because there is no friction, there may be no growth. Jupiter trine Sun is confidence, but without challenge, it can become entitlement.

---

### ☍ Opposition (180°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Polarity, projection, confrontation.

**Traditional Teaching:** The opposition (Hellenistic: *diameter*) connects planets 180° apart (seven signs inclusive, e.g., Aries to Libra).[^1][^8] It is **of the nature of Saturn** and is considered "adversarial," "controversial," and "rivaling"—signifying rejection, separation, and conflict.[^8]

This is the most difficult configuration, by which malefics are capable of doing the most harm. Benefics in opposition are "slack" or less positive, often indicating estrangement or discord even in relationships.[^8] Lilly calls it "perfect hatred or enmity."[^2]

**Hellenistic Orb:** Sign-based; degree-based perfection within 3° of exact 180°.[^9]

**Example:** Moon opposed by Mars—in the chart of writer Michael Patrick MacDonald, a diurnal Moon in Libra opposed by Mars in Aries (contrary to sect) indicated a life defined by "tragic ends" of siblings, including suicide, reflecting the adversarial nature and 3rd house significations.[^8]

**Psychological Synthesis:** The opposition is **projection and mirroring**—what we cannot own within ourselves, we encounter "out there" in the other. This is [[The Syzygy]]—Anima/Animus projected onto partner, enemy, or rival. Moon opposite Saturn is the need for emotional security confronting the fear of abandonment. The work of the opposition is to **withdraw projection** and own both poles internally.

## Orbs and Application

In **Hellenistic practice**, aspects were primarily **sign-based**: any planet in Aries is in square to any planet in Cancer, regardless of degree.[^9] However, **degree-based aspects** determined intensity and timing.

**The 3-Degree Rule:** An aspect is considered "perfect" or "complete" when planets are within 3° of the exact configuration. This range defines **application** or **joining** (*sunaphe*).[^9]

**The Moon's Exception:** The Moon, with her swifter motion, has a wider range for application—often cited as **13°**, representing her average daily motion.[^9]

**Traditional Orbs (Lilly):** Each planet has a specific orb (sphere of influence), and aspects form when the combined "moiety" (half-orb of each planet) overlaps. For example, Sun's orb is 15°, Moon's is 12.5°; their combined moiety for conjunction is 13.75°.[^6]

## Benefic vs. Malefic Aspects

Aspects are classified by their geometric relationship to the **Thema Mundi** (the mythical birth chart of the cosmos) and planetary natures:[^8]

**Benefic Aspects:**
- **Trine (120°):** Of the nature of Jupiter—most harmonious, supportive
- **Sextile (60°):** Of the nature of Venus—gentle harmony, cooperation

**Malefic Aspects:**
- **Square (90°):** Of the nature of Mars—struggle, intensity, friction
- **Opposition (180°):** Of the nature of Saturn—adversarial, confrontational

**Conjunction (0°):** Neutral—takes the nature of the planets involved.

Brennan discusses **bonification** (being improved by benefic aspects) and **maltreatment** (being harmed by malefic aspects), which adds complexity beyond the aspect shape itself.[^8]

## Minor Aspects

Lilly acknowledges **minor aspects** (semisextile 30°, semiquadrate 45°, quintile 72°, sesquiquadrate 135°, quincunx 150°) but considers them secondary to the five major configurations.[^7] These were used more in medieval and Renaissance practice than in Hellenistic astrology.

In modern psychological astrology, the **quincunx (150°)** is often emphasized as an aspect of adjustment and incongruity—two planets that cannot "see" each other (in incompatible signs by element and modality) creating subtle, persistent tension.
