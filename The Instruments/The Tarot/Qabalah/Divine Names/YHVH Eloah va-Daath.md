# YHVH Eloah va-Daath
*Lord God of Knowledge — The Divine Name of Tiphareth*

---

## Overview

**YHVH Eloah va-Daath** (Hebrew: יהוה אלוה ודעת, "Lord God of Knowledge") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Tiphareth]]** (Beauty), the sixth Sephirah on the [[The Tree of Life]] — the solar center, the seat of the Higher Self, the harmonizer that reconciles the opposing pillars of Mercy and Severity.

The name combines three elements:
- **YHVH** (יהוה) — The Tetragrammaton, the four-letter name of God
- **Eloah** (אלוה) — "God" (the singular form of Elohim — one God, not the plurality of forces)
- **va-Daath** (ודעת) — "and Knowledge," referring to [[Daath]], the invisible Sephirah in the Abyss

This is the only Divine Name that explicitly incorporates **Daath** — the bridge across the Abyss. This is no accident: Tiphareth is the Sephirah from which the Abyss crossing is undertaken, and its Divine Name announces that it carries the Knowledge required for the journey.

## Source Teachings

### The Zohar: The Voice

The Zohar centrally symbolizes Tiphareth through the Tetragrammaton YHVH and calls it the "**Blessed Holy One**" (*Qudsha Brikh Hu*) — the divine principle most frequently encountered in Zoharic discourse.[^1] Tiphareth is the **Voice** (*Qol*) that sounds between Mercy and Severity: not the silence of Kether, not the word of Malkuth, but the *voice* that makes communication between the divine and the human possible.

The Zohar describes Tiphareth as the "**central realization of the Divine Mind**" — the point where God becomes not merely power (Chesed/Geburah) but *self-aware*, where divine energy recognizes itself and can be recognized by creation.[^2]

### The Daath Connection

The inclusion of *va-Daath* ("and Knowledge") in this name is unique among the ten Divine Names. It suggests that Tiphareth holds a **special relationship to the Abyss**: it is the highest point of consciousness that the ego can reach *without* being destroyed, and it is the launching point from which the Abyss crossing is attempted.

Tiphareth's "Knowledge" is not intellectual accumulation but **gnosis** — direct, participatory knowing that transforms the knower. The name declares: this is the place where God is known not as concept but as encounter.

## The Solar Principle

Tiphareth is the **Sun** on the Tree — the center around which the other Sephiroth revolve, the source of light that illuminates everything below it and reflects everything above it. The sun metaphor reveals Tiphareth's dual nature:

- **Downward:** Tiphareth illuminates the lower Tree (Netzach, Hod, Yesod, Malkuth), making the divine visible and comprehensible
- **Upward:** Tiphareth reflects the Supernals (Kether, Chokmah, Binah), making the incomprehensible at least *intuitable*

In Christian mysticism, Tiphareth is associated with the **Christ principle** — the divine made human, the mediator between God and creation. The Zohar's "Blessed Holy One" functions identically: the aspect of God that bridges the infinite and the finite, the abstract and the embodied.[^3]

## The Name in Practice

### Vibration

In the [[Middle Pillar]] Exercise, YHVH Eloah va-Daath is vibrated at the **heart center** (third station, after Eheieh at the crown and YHVH Elohim at the throat). A sphere of golden-yellow light is visualized at the heart while the name is intoned.

The vibration is the longest of the five Middle Pillar names, reflecting Tiphareth's role as the most *complex* Sephirah — the one that must hold the most opposing forces in balance.

### The Harmonizer

When working with this name, the practitioner invokes the capacity to **hold opposites without collapsing into either pole**: mercy and severity, expansion and restriction, above and below. YHVH Eloah va-Daath is the name you vibrate when you need to find the center between extremes — the beauty that emerges only when neither force dominates.

## Jungian Parallels

Tiphareth corresponds to the ***Self*** as experienced — not the unknowable Self of Kether but the Self as it manifests through the process of [[Individuation Process|individuation]]: the archetype of wholeness that organizes the personality around a center deeper than the ego.[^4]

The "Lord God of Knowledge" is the Self's invitation to the ego: *know me*. Not through thinking but through the kind of knowing that transforms the knower — what Jung called the ***coniunctio***, the alchemical marriage of conscious and unconscious, masculine and feminine, solar and lunar. The name's solar quality mirrors the alchemical *sol* — the gold of integrated consciousness.[^5]

The inclusion of *Daath* in the name also parallels Jung's insistence that genuine self-knowledge requires **confrontation with the unconscious** — the Abyss. You cannot reach the Self (Tiphareth) without passing through the territory where the ego's certainties dissolve (Daath). Knowledge of God and knowledge of Self are, in both Qabalah and analytical psychology, the same journey.

## Notes

[^1]: Zohar — Tiphareth as *Qudsha Brikh Hu* ("Blessed Holy One"), the most frequently referenced aspect of divinity in Zoharic literature, symbolized by YHVH.

[^2]: Wang, *The Qabalistic Tarot* — YHVH Eloah va-Daath as "ruling over the Light of the Universe," the central realization of the Divine Mind.

[^3]: The Christ-Tiphareth correspondence is a development of Christian Qabalah (Pico della Mirandola, Reuchlin) and the Golden Dawn. Traditional Jewish Kabbalah does not make this identification.

[^4]: Jung, CW 9ii (*Aion*) — The Self as the archetype of wholeness, experienced through individuation as the center "that is also the circumference."

[^5]: Jung, CW 14 (*Mysterium Coniunctionis*) — The *coniunctio* as the union of opposites, symbolized alchemically by Sol (gold/consciousness) and Luna (silver/unconscious).
