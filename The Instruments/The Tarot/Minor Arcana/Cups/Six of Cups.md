# Six of Cups
*The Lord of Pleasure*

---

## Traditional Symbolism

According to Waite's *Pictorial Key to the Tarot*, the Six of Cups signifies **new relations, new knowledge, new environment, and especially things and circumstances of the past; the beginning of steady increase and happiness**. [^1] When the Six of Cups appears upright, it speaks to the realm of memory and nostalgia—not the fixated grief of the Five, but the tender retrieval of what was loved.

The Golden Dawn titles this card the **"Lord of Pleasure"** [^2]—a name that at first seems incongruous with the melancholy of memory. But this is *pleasure recovered*: the discovery that what you loved is not gone but *internalized*, that the past lives within you as a resource rather than a wound. After the Loss of Pleasure (Five), comes Pleasure itself (Six)—not new pleasure, but the realization that old pleasure is still accessible.

The card is attributed to **Sun in Scorpio** [^3]—an unusual combination: the luminary of consciousness and vitality descending into the sign of depth, shadow, and the underworld. This is light penetrating darkness, warmth reaching into cold places. The Sun in Scorpio does not deny Scorpio's depths; it *illuminates* them.

The card represents **Tiphareth (Beauty) in Briah (the World of Formation/Emotion)**. [^4] Tiphareth, the sixth Sephirah, is the harmonizing center of the Tree of Life—the heart that balances all opposites, the sphere of the Sun and the child. In the emotional realm of Briah, Tiphareth manifests as *harmony restored*: the beginning of healing after the Five's rupture.

The number **Six** in Qabalah represents balance, harmony, and the integration of opposites. Where Five disrupts, Six *heals*. The Sixes across all suits are cards of recovery and rebalancing: victory (Wands), pleasure (Cups), science (Swords), success (Pentacles). Six is the number of the hexagram—two interlocking triangles, above and below united.

This is one of the most gentle cards in the Tarot. It depicts not the peak of joy (that was the Three) nor the depths of sorrow (that was the Five), but the quiet contentment of *remembering well*. The children in the garden are not ecstatic; they are *peaceful*. The past is present, but as gift rather than burden.

When the Six of Cups appears **reversed**, Waite notes: **the future, renewal; that which will come to pass presently**. [^5] The reversal shifts the temporal orientation—from past to future, from memory to anticipation. What the upright card finds in the past, the reversed card seeks in what is coming.

The key teaching: **The past is not a prison unless you try to live there. Remembered rightly, it is a wellspring.**

## Divination Use
**Upright:** Nostalgia, memories of childhood, the past revisited with tenderness. Innocence recovered (not naivety, but openness). Gifts from the past—inheritance, reunion with old friends, return to a childhood home. Generosity, sharing, the gift freely given. The beginning of healing after loss.

*Keywords:* Nostalgia, memory, childhood, innocence, reunion, inheritance, the past, gentleness, healing, gift-giving.

**Reversed (per Waite):** The future, renewal, that which will come to pass. The reversal shifts from past to future—instead of drawing on memory, you look forward to what is being born. New beginnings, releasing the past, anticipation rather than nostalgia.

## Esoteric Interpretation

### The Sephirotic Lens: Tiphareth as the Six

**Tiphareth** is the sixth Sephirah, titled **Beauty** (*Tiferet* in Hebrew). It occupies the center of the Tree of Life—the heart position where all paths converge. Tiphareth is the point of balance between above and below, severity and mercy, expansion and contraction.

In the Qabalistic framework, Tiphareth represents:
- **Beauty and Harmony**: The aesthetic principle, the integration that produces grace
- **The Heart**: The central organ of the body, the meeting point of all systems
- **The Sun**: The luminary that illuminates and warms, the source of conscious light
- **The Child**: The divine child, the miraculous birth, the point of renewal
- **The Number Six**: Balance, the hexagram, the integration of opposites

Tiphareth-in-Water (the Cups suit, Briah) expresses the Six as **emotional harmony**—the restoration of balance after the Five's rupture. Where the Five was grief, the Six is *healing*. Where the Five stared at spilled cups, the Six has turned around and found that the past still nourishes.

Tiphareth's beauty, when expressed in the emotional realm, becomes *the beauty of memory*. What you loved is not gone; it lives within you. The people, places, and experiences of your past are not merely historical facts—they are *present resources*, available to you now if you know how to access them.

The Six of Cups teaches that **the past is a garden you can visit**. Not to live there (that would be regression), not to mourn it (that was the Five's work), but to draw nourishment from it. The children in the garden are not trapped; they are *playing*. The past, remembered rightly, is not a prison but a playground.

### The Planetary Expression: Sun Through Scorpio

**The Sun** is the celestial body of consciousness, vitality, and the illuminating principle. Where the Moon reflects, the Sun *radiates*. Where the Moon is unconscious, the Sun is conscious. The Sun governs:
- **Consciousness**: The light of awareness, the principle of knowing
- **Vitality**: Life force, energy, the power that animates
- **The Self**: In Jungian terms, the core of identity, the organizing principle
- **Illumination**: Making visible what was hidden, bringing clarity
- **The Father**: The masculine principle of generation and authority (complementing the Moon's Mother)

The Sun is hot and dry, masculine (in the archetypal sense), and associated with gold, the lion, and Sunday.

**Scorpio**, as we've explored, is the fixed water sign—depth, intensity, transformation, the underworld. Scorpio is ruled by Mars (traditionally) and Pluto (in modern astrology). It governs the realm of what is hidden, forbidden, powerful, and transformative.

**Sun in Scorpio** creates a unique dynamic:
- **Light in the depths**: The conscious principle descending into the unconscious realm
- **Illuminated shadow**: What was hidden becomes visible, what was repressed becomes conscious
- **Intensity with clarity**: Scorpio's depth combined with solar consciousness produces *deep seeing*
- **The underworld warmed**: The Sun brings warmth even to cold places; Scorpio's realm is not only exposed but *heated*
- **Death and rebirth witnessed**: The Sun in Scorpio sees the transformation process clearly

The second decan of Scorpio (10°-20°) is traditionally associated with the Sun itself in some systems. This is the middle passage—past the initial plunge (first decan, Mars) but not yet at the emergence (third decan, Venus). This is Scorpio at its most interior, and the Sun illuminates that interior.

The Six of Cups, as Sun in the second decan of Scorpio, represents **consciousness recovering what was lost to the unconscious**. The Five descended into grief; the Six brings the light of awareness to that descent. The past is not merely felt (unconsciously) but *remembered* (consciously). This is the difference between being haunted by the past and being nourished by it.

### The Suit Philosophy: Water at the Stage of Six

The **Cups** suit represents the journey of the **heart** from spark to completion. At the stage of **Six**, Water achieves *harmony*—the balance point after the disruption of the Five.

The Ace is the gift of emotion. The Two is union. The Three is celebration. The Four is stagnation. The Five is loss. The Six is *what remains when the mourning is done*—and what remains is the memory of what was loved.

At this stage, Water is:
- **Harmonious**: The turbulence has settled; the pool is clear again
- **Nostalgic**: The attention turns backward, but with tenderness rather than fixation
- **Generative**: Memory is not passive but *active*—it produces, it gives
- **Childlike**: Not childish (regression), but childlike (innocence, openness, wonder)

The movement from Five to Six in Cups is the movement from **grief to memory**. The Five mourned what was lost; the Six discovers that what was lost still lives within. The Five stared at spilled cups; the Six finds that the cups were not the point—the *love* was the point, and love cannot be spilled.

But the Six introduces a crucial teaching: **memory must serve the present, not replace it**. The children in the garden are playing; they are not *escaping*. Nostalgia becomes pathological when it substitutes for engagement with the present. Healthy nostalgia *enriches* the present with the resources of the past.

### Numerical Progression and Pattern

The **Six** in any suit represents balance, harmony, and the restoration that follows the Five's disruption.

**What came before:** The **Five of Cups** is grief—the figure in black, mourning the spilled cups, unable to see what remains. The Five was fixated on loss; the Six has *turned around*.

**The transition from Five to Six:** The mourning has done its work. Not that grief is "over" (grief is never truly over), but that acute grief has yielded to integrated memory. The figure in black has removed the cloak; the children in the garden have emerged from the shadow. This is the movement from **loss to legacy**, from mourning to memory, from fixation to freedom.

This transition is crucial: it is the recognition that **what you loved is not destroyed by loss—it is transformed into memory**. The Five taught you that loss is real; the Six teaches that love is also real, and love survives loss. The cups spilled, but the love that filled them remains.

**What comes after:** The **Seven of Cups** is fantasy, illusion, the proliferation of imagined possibilities. If the Six is healthy memory, the Seven is *unhealthy imagination*—the confusion of dream and reality. The Six remembers what was; the Seven imagines what might be (and loses itself in the imagining).

**Position in the arc:** The Six of Cups is the **heart of the journey**—appropriately, since Tiphareth is the heart of the Tree. The Cups journey goes from joy (Ace-Three) through crisis (Four-Seven) to resolution (Eight-Ten). The Six is the turning point within the crisis—the moment when descent becomes ascent, when loss begins to heal.

### Rider-Waite Symbolism: A Deep Dive

The Rider-Waite image of the Six of Cups is one of gentle nostalgia. Let us examine each element:

#### The Two Children: Innocence and Generosity

Two children stand in an old garden. One (often depicted as larger, perhaps older) offers a cup filled with white flowers to the other (smaller, perhaps younger). The scene is tender, intimate, timeless.

The **two children** represent:
- **Innocence**: Not naivety but *openness*—the state before cynicism, before the shell
- **The past**: Children represent earlier life stages; their presence evokes memory
- **Generosity**: The gift freely given, without expectation of return
- **The inner child**: Psychologically, the childlike aspects of the self that survive into adulthood

The **offering gesture** signifies:
- **Gift-giving**: The essence of love is generosity; the child gives without agenda
- **Transmission**: Something is being passed from one to another—inheritance, teaching, blessing
- **The Cups suit's highest expression**: Water is meant to flow, to be shared; the child enacts this

The **size difference** (if present) may suggest:
- **Past self offering to present self**: The older child (past) gives to the younger (present)
- **Generational transmission**: Ancestors offering to descendants
- **The Self and the ego**: The larger (Self) nourishing the smaller (ego)

#### The Six Cups: Abundance Restored

Six golden cups are arranged in the scene, often in a row or two rows of three. Each cup contains white flowers—typically five-petaled, star-shaped flowers.

The **six cups** represent:
- **Restored abundance**: Where the Five had only two standing cups, the Six has all six upright
- **The hexagram**: Six points, balance, the integration of above and below
- **Memory's harvest**: Each cup is a recovered memory, a blessing retrieved from the past

The **white flowers** represent:
- **Purity**: White is the color of innocence, unmarked by shadow
- **The five-petaled flower**: Often identified with the rose or the forget-me-not—memory, love, remembrance
- **Life in the vessel**: The cups are not empty but filled with living beauty
- **The Star's flower**: The flowers echo the Star (XVII), suggesting hope and renewal

The flowers are **in the cups**, not beside them—suggesting that memory *fills* the emotional vessels, that the past is not separate from present feeling but integral to it.

#### The Garden: The Protected Space

The children stand in a garden, often depicted with a low wall, a path, and architectural elements (perhaps a house or manor in the background).

The **garden** represents:
- **The temenos**: The sacred enclosure, the protected space where transformation occurs
- **Childhood's realm**: The protected world of early life, before you were thrust into the wider world
- **The inner world**: Psychologically, the garden is the interior landscape where memory lives
- **Eden before the Fall**: The state of grace before knowledge of good and evil complicated everything

The **wall** (if present) signifies:
- **Protection**: The garden is enclosed, safe, set apart from the world's violence
- **Boundary**: The past is *separate* from the present; you visit it, you don't live there
- **Definition**: The wall creates the garden by defining its limits

The **path** (if present) suggests:
- **Entry and exit**: You can come into the garden and leave it—it is not a trap
- **The way**: Memory has a structure, a path to follow
- **Journey**: Even in this peaceful scene, movement is implied

#### The Background: Home and Hearth

In the background, architectural elements suggest a home—perhaps a manor house, perhaps a cottage. An older figure (sometimes identified as a departing figure) may be visible.

The **house** represents:
- **Home**: The dwelling place, the foundation of security
- **The past as dwelling**: Your history is where you come from, your original home
- **Inheritance**: The house may be what you inherit from your ancestors
- **The Self**: In dream symbolism, houses represent the psyche; the house in the background is the greater self

The **departing figure** (if present) may represent:
- **The past receding**: What was present becoming memory
- **Adult responsibilities**: The figure leaving for the world while the children remain in the garden
- **Time's passage**: The scene is not frozen; it exists in time, and time moves

#### The Sky and Light: Warmth and Clarity

The sky is often clear and golden, suggesting warmth, late afternoon light, the glow of memory.

The **golden light** signifies:
- **The Sun**: Tiphareth's sphere, consciousness illuminating the scene
- **Nostalgia's glow**: Memory softens and warms; the past seems golden in retrospect
- **Blessing**: The light suggests divine favor, grace descending
- **Autumn**: The season of harvest, of gathering what has grown; appropriate to memory

### Esoteric and Cross-Tradition Parallels

The Six of Cups resonates across multiple wisdom traditions:

#### The Garden of Eden: Paradise and Innocence

In the Genesis narrative, **Eden** is the garden where humanity lived before the Fall—the state of innocence before knowledge of good and evil introduced shame, labor, and death. The cherubim with the flaming sword guard the gate; we cannot return.

The Six of Cups is the Tarot's Eden—not literally returnable, but *recoverable in memory*. The garden still exists, not in external geography but in internal landscape. The innocence of childhood is not truly lost; it is *buried*, and can be excavated through right remembering.

#### The Platonic Anamnesis: Remembrance as Knowledge

In Plato's philosophy, **anamnesis** is the theory that learning is actually *remembering*—that the soul, before birth, knew all truths, and incarnation caused forgetting. Education is the process of recovering what was always known.

The Six of Cups enacts anamnesis in the emotional realm. The love you seek is not new; it is *remembered*. The innocence you long for is not impossible; it is *recovered*. The past does not merely inform the present; it *constitutes* it. You are made of your memories.

#### The I Ching Hexagram 58: The Joyous/Lake (Dui)

In the *I Ching*, **Hexagram 58** (兌 *Dui*, "The Joyous" or "The Lake") represents joy, pleasure, and the gentle influence of happiness. The lake (water) above the lake—joy doubled.

The *Judgment* says: "The Joyous. Success. Perseverance is favorable."

Both the Six of Cups and Hexagram 58 describe **the natural pleasure that arises from right relationship**. The lake gives joy by being what it is—a reflective, receptive surface. The Six of Cups gives joy through memory—not grasping at the past, but *receiving* it as it offers itself.

#### The Proust's Madeleine: Involuntary Memory

In Marcel Proust's *In Search of Lost Time*, the narrator tastes a madeleine dipped in tea and is flooded with involuntary memories of childhood. The sensory experience unlocks what was thought lost.

The Six of Cups is this Proustian experience rendered in image. The children, the garden, the cups of flowers—these are not merely seen but *felt*. The card does not depict memory as intellectual retrieval but as *embodied experience*. The past is not thought; it is *tasted*.

#### The Buddhist Understanding of Dependent Arising

In Buddhist philosophy, **pratītyasamutpāda** (dependent arising) teaches that all phenomena arise in dependence on conditions—including the present, which arises from the past. You are not separate from your history; you *are* your history, continuing.

The Six of Cups illustrates this teaching: the children in the garden are not "back then"—they are *now*, because the past is not separate from the present. The memory is not a photograph of what was; it is a *living presence* in what is.

### Psychological and Jungian Depth

In Jungian psychology, the Six of Cups represents **the ego's relationship to the personal past and the inner child**—the recovery of what was lost through conscious remembering.

#### The Inner Child and Its Retrieval

Jung and subsequent Jungian thinkers (particularly Alice Miller and Donald Winnicott) recognized the **inner child** as a crucial aspect of the psyche—the repository of early experience, creativity, spontaneity, and wonder. When the inner child is split off (through trauma, neglect, or excessive adaptation), the adult becomes rigid, defended, unable to play.

The Six of Cups depicts the *recovery* of the inner child—not as regression (trying to become a child again) but as *integration* (making the child's gifts available to the adult). The children in the garden are not the querent literally returning to childhood; they are the querent's childlike aspects, now accessible.

#### Memory and the Collective Unconscious

Beyond personal memory, the Six of Cups may touch the **collective unconscious**—the shared psychic inheritance of humanity. The garden, the children, the gifts of flowers—these are archetypal images, not merely personal recollections.

The card suggests that *your* childhood connects to *all* childhood, that your memories participate in the great human memory of innocence, loss, and recovery. When you remember rightly, you access not only your own past but the wisdom of the ancestors.

#### The Puer/Puella Archetype

In Jungian typology, the **Puer Aeternus** (eternal boy) or **Puella Aeterna** (eternal girl) is the archetype of youth, potential, and the refusal to grow up. In its shadow form, the Puer/Puella remains childish, avoids responsibility, and lives in fantasy.

The Six of Cups, properly integrated, is the *gift* of the Puer/Puella without its shadow. The childlike wonder, the capacity for play, the openness to experience—these are available *without* the corresponding refusal to mature. The integrated Six can be childlike and adult simultaneously.

#### Shadow Expressions of the Six of Cups

When unconscious or rejected, the Six of Cups manifests pathologically:

- **Living in the past**: The garden becomes a hiding place from present challenges. "Things were better then" becomes an excuse for refusing to engage with now.

- **Idealization of childhood**: The past was not actually perfect; every childhood contains shadow. The Six's shadow idealizes, denies the difficulties, and creates a false Eden that never existed.

- **Regression**: Actually trying to *become* a child again—through dependency, through refusing adult responsibility, through relationships that recreate parent-child dynamics inappropriately.

- **Nostalgia as escape**: Using memory to avoid present pain. "I'll just think about the good old days" becomes a chronic defense against dealing with current difficulties.

- **Inability to create new memories**: So attached to past joys that you cannot *generate* new ones. The garden is visited obsessively; no new gardens are planted.

### The Gift of Integration

When the Six of Cups is consciously integrated, it offers these gifts:

**The Capacity for Nostalgia Without Regression**: The integrated Six can *visit* the past without *living* there. Memory becomes a resource, a wellspring, a garden to walk through—but the walker returns to the present, nourished.

**The Inner Child as Ally**: The integrated Six has access to childlike wonder, playfulness, and creativity without losing adult competence. The child and the adult collaborate rather than conflict.

**Generosity of Spirit**: The integrated Six has received from the past and can therefore *give* in the present. The child offering the cup becomes a model for all giving—freely, without agenda, from overflow rather than calculation.

**Healing Relationship to the Past**: The integrated Six neither denies the past (repression) nor is controlled by it (obsession). The past is *held* with tenderness—its gifts are received, its wounds are acknowledged, its lessons are integrated.

**The Sense of Continuity**: The integrated Six experiences life as a *story*, not a series of disconnected moments. You are not merely who you are now; you are who you have been, becoming who you will be. Memory provides the thread of continuity that makes meaning possible.

### Relationship to Adjacent Cards

**Preceding Card: [[Five of Cups]]**
The Five of Cups is grief, loss, and fixation on what is gone. The Five stared at spilled cups, unable to turn around. The Six has *turned*—not away from the loss (the loss is real), but toward what survives. The Five taught that loss is real; the Six discovers that love survives loss.

**Following Card: [[Seven of Cups]]**
The Seven of Cups is fantasy, illusion, and the confusion of imagination with reality. If the Six is healthy memory (recalling what *was*), the Seven is unhealthy imagination (projecting what might be without grounding). The movement from Six to Seven is the movement from past to future, from remembering to fantasizing.

#### Corresponding Cards in Other Suits
- **[[Six of Wands]]** (Fire): Victory and public recognition. Where Cups remembers privately, Wands celebrates publicly.
- **[[Six of Swords]]** (Air): Passage and transition. Both Sixes involve movement—Cups moves through time (memory), Swords moves through space (journey).
- **[[Six of Pentacles]]** (Earth): Generosity and balance of resources. Both Sixes involve giving—Cups gives emotionally, Pentacles gives materially.

All Sixes represent **balance and harmony**. The Six of Cups is the most *interior* of the Sixes—the harmony is within the heart, between past and present.

### The Central Paradox: The Past Is Present

The ultimate mystery of the Six of Cups is this: **What you remember is not "then"—it is now, because you are remembering it now.**

The children in the garden exist in the eternal present of memory. They do not grow old; they do not leave the garden; they continue to offer flowers, forever. This is both the gift and the danger of memory: it preserves what time would otherwise destroy.

But preservation is not resurrection. The children in the garden are not the actual children from your past—they are *images*, *symbols*, *presences*. To confuse the image with the reality is to become trapped in the garden. To receive the image *as image*—to let it nourish you without demanding that it become flesh—is to use memory rightly.

The card asks: *Can you receive the gifts of the past without trying to live there? Can you let the children offer their flowers without grasping at their hands? Can you visit the garden and then return to the street, carrying the garden within you?*

The Lord of Pleasure is the pleasure of remembering well—neither clinging nor rejecting, but receiving.
