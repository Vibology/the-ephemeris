# Left Angle Cross of Endeavor (2)

## Gates: 48/21/53/54 | Quarter of Duality

### Ra's Keynote
> "People with a driving desire to be in control so they can do something with their depth; this is the 'I will do it myself' attitude of self-publishers."[^1]

## The Four Gates

### Personality Sun: Gate 48 - The Well (Depth)
**Center:** Spleen | **Circuitry:** Collective Understanding (Logic)

Gate 48 is **depth of resources and knowledge**—the capacity to assess adequacy and draw from deep reserves. As the Personality Sun, this defines the conscious purpose: to know one's depth and the driving need to do something meaningful with it.

### Personality Earth: Gate 21 - Biting Through (The Hunter/Huntress)
**Center:** Heart (Ego) | **Circuitry:** Tribal Ego

Gate 21 grounds the depth with **the power to be in control**—the willpower and authority to bite through interference. This provides the ego strength to ensure the depth can be expressed without being blocked.

### Design Sun: Gate 53 - Development (Beginnings)
**Center:** Root | **Circuitry:** Collective Sensing (Abstract)

Gate 53 operates unconsciously as **the pressure to begin new cycles**—the drive to start, initiate, and develop. This fuels the Endeavor cross with the energy to constantly begin expressing the depth.

### Design Earth: Gate 54 - The Marrying Maiden (Drive)
**Center:** Root | **Circuitry:** Tribal Ego

Gate 54 grounds the developmental pressure with **ambition**—the drive to rise up and transform status. This ensures the endeavor has the ambition to reach beyond current position.

## Cross Theme

The **LAX of Endeavor (2)** in the Quarter of Duality carries the archetype of the **self-reliant creator**—one whose deep resources must be expressed through personal control.

As a **Left Angle Cross**, this is a **trans-personal destiny**, but the keynote reveals something crucial: the "I will do it myself" attitude. This is not isolation—it is the recognition that certain depths can only be developed through taking personal control of the endeavor.

The shift from Endeavor 1 to Endeavor 2 is significant:
- **Endeavor 1** (Quarter of Initiation): Bringing together people with depth
- **Endeavor 2** (Quarter of Duality): Doing something with one's own depth

In the Quarter of Duality, endeavor becomes **relational through independence**. The "self-publishers" Ra mentions are not hermits—they bring their depth into relationship with the world on their own terms. The bonding happens through the work itself, through sharing what has been independently created.

This cross bridges circuits:
- **Collective Understanding** (48): The depth that must be expressed
- **Tribal Ego** (21/54): The willpower to control and the ambition to rise
- **Collective Sensing** (53): The developmental pressure to begin

The result is someone who **knows their depth** (48), **must control how it's expressed** (21), **feels pressure to begin** (53), and has the **ambition to succeed** (54). This is the self-publisher, the independent developer, the one who says "I will do it myself" not from ego but from necessity.

The profiles associated with this cross (5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3) ensure the independent endeavor carries either heretic/savior projection (Line 5) or role model demonstration (Line 6).

## Quarter Context

**Quarter of Duality | Realm of Jupiter | Purpose through Bonding**

In this quarter, the Endeavor cross fulfills its purpose through **bonding with the world through independent creation**. This seems paradoxical—how does "I will do it myself" fulfill purpose through bonding?

The answer lies in the Quarter of Duality's deeper meaning. Bonding is not only about partnership—it is about the relationship between self and other. The self-publisher bonds with readers. The independent developer bonds with users. The creative entrepreneur bonds with customers. The bonding happens through the offering of depth.

Jupiter's realm emphasizes expansion through relationship. The self-created work expands when it meets its audience. The depth becomes valuable when it serves others. The "I will do it myself" is not the end—it is the means by which deep resources become available for bonding.

## Shadow Expression

- **Control obsession:** Gate 21's power becomes inability to delegate or trust, exhausting oneself through micromanagement
- **Inadequacy despite depth:** Gate 48's awareness of resources becomes chronic feeling of never being ready, never deep enough
- **Perpetual starting:** Gate 53's pressure to begin prevents completion, abandoning projects before depth is fully expressed
- **Ambitious isolation:** Gate 54's drive to rise creates competition where collaboration would serve better
- **Self-publishing martyrdom:** "I will do it myself" becomes resentment that others don't help, rather than embrace of the independent path

---

## Highest Expression

- **Sovereign creation:** Taking control of how depth is expressed, neither needing permission nor resentment
- **Resourceful depth:** Trusting that the well provides, and beginning to express it without waiting for perfect adequacy
- **Developmental independence:** Initiating cycles of creation that allow depth to mature into shareable form
- **Ambitious service:** Rising through the quality of what is offered, ambition expressed through excellence
- **Karmic contribution:** Understanding that the independent endeavor serves trans-personal purpose—the depth is not just personal, but something the world needs
