# The Sephiroth
*The Ten Emanations of Divine Consciousness*

---

## Overview

The **Sephiroth** (Hebrew: ספירות, singular *Sephirah*) are the ten emanations or attributes through which [[Ain Soph Aur|Ein Sof]] (the Infinite) reveals itself and creates the physical and metaphysical realms. They are the "vessels" that receive and transmit divine light, forming the structure of the [[The Tree of Life]].

The word *Sephiroth* derives from the Hebrew root ספר (*saphar*), carrying a triple meaning: "to count" (the Sephiroth are *numbers*), "to tell" (they are *stories*), and "to shine" (they are *lights*).[^1] The Sephiroth are simultaneously the mathematics, the narrative, and the radiance of creation — the numbers through which God counts reality into being, the stories through which being makes itself known, and the lights by which consciousness sees.

The Sefer Yetzirah insists on their number with extraordinary emphasis: "**Ten is the number of the ineffable Sephiroth — ten and not nine, ten and not eleven.**"[^2] The number is not arbitrary but architecturally necessary: ten is the minimum structure that can express the full range of divine self-manifestation while maintaining unity.

## The Ten Sephiroth

### The Supernal Triad

The first three Sephiroth form the [[Supernal Triangle]] — the realm of pure archetype above [[The Abyss]], too vast for individuated consciousness:

| # | Sephirah | Translation | Planet | Archangel | Function |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | [[Kether]] | Crown | Primum Mobile | [[Metatron]] | Pure being, divine will, the first point |
| 2 | [[Chokmah]] | Wisdom | Zodiac/Stars | [[Raziel]] | Pure force, the Father, active creative energy |
| 3 | [[Binah]] | Understanding | Saturn | [[Tzaphkiel]] | Pure form, the Mother, receptive shaping |

### The Ethical Triad

The middle three Sephiroth form the moral and relational center of the Tree:

| # | Sephirah | Translation | Planet | Archangel | Function |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 4 | [[Chesed]] | Mercy | Jupiter | [[Tzadkiel]] | Expansion, love, the generous king |
| 5 | [[Geburah]] | Strength/Severity | Mars | [[Kamael]] | Restriction, judgment, the warrior |
| 6 | [[Tiphareth]] | Beauty | Sun | [[Michael]]/[[Raphael]] | Harmony, the heart, the reconciler |

### The Astral Triad

The lower three Sephiroth form the realm of personality, psyche, and manifestation:

| # | Sephirah | Translation | Planet | Archangel | Function |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 7 | [[Netzach]] | Victory | Venus | [[Haniel]] | Emotion, desire, art, instinct |
| 8 | [[Hod]] | Splendor | Mercury | [[Michael]]/[[Raphael]] | Intellect, language, analysis |
| 9 | [[Yesod]] | Foundation | Moon | [[Gabriel]] | The unconscious, dreams, the ego |

### The Kingdom

| # | Sephirah | Translation | Planet | Archangel | Function |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 10 | [[Malkuth]] | Kingdom | Earth | [[Sandalphon]] | Physical reality, the body, the world |

### The Invisible Sephirah

[[Daath]] (Knowledge) occupies [[The Abyss]] between the Supernal Triad and the lower seven. It is not counted among the ten but serves as the *interface* between the unmanifest and the manifest — the bridge the soul crosses when ascending toward the Supernals.

## Structural Principles

### The Lightning Flash

The order of emanation follows the **Lightning Flash** (or *Flaming Sword*) — a zigzag path descending from Kether through each Sephirah in numerical order to Malkuth. This is the path of *creation*: divine energy descending from unity through progressive differentiation to material form.[^3]

The Lightning Flash crosses the Tree in a serpentine pattern: right (Chokmah) → left (Binah) → right (Chesed) → left (Geburah) → center (Tiphareth) → right (Netzach) → left (Hod) → center (Yesod) → center (Malkuth). Each crossing polarizes the energy further, until what begins as undifferentiated light in Kether arrives as concrete manifestation in Malkuth.

### The Serpent of Wisdom

The **Serpent of Wisdom** (*Nachash*) traces the reverse path — ascending from Malkuth through each Sephirah in reverse order. This is the path of *return*: consciousness ascending from matter through progressive refinement to divine unity. The Serpent passes through each of the 22 paths, encountering every Hebrew letter and every Tarot trump along the way.

### Pairs and Polarities

The Sephiroth work in **complementary pairs** across the Pillars:

- **Chokmah — Binah:** Force and Form (the Supernal parents)
- **Chesed — Geburah:** Mercy and Severity (the ethical polarity)
- **Netzach — Hod:** Feeling and Thinking (the functional polarity)

Each pair requires both members. Chesed without Geburah is indulgence; Geburah without Chesed is cruelty. Netzach without Hod is blind passion; Hod without Netzach is sterile analysis. The Middle Pillar Sephiroth (Kether, Tiphareth, Yesod, Malkuth) reconcile these polarities at successively denser levels.

## The Sephiroth and the Divine Names

Each Sephirah is governed by a **Divine Name** — the Name of God that activates and sustains that particular quality of emanation:

| Sephirah | Divine Name | Translation |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Kether | [[Eheieh]] | I Am |
| Chokmah | Yah | — |
| Binah | YHVH Elohim | Lord God |
| Chesed | El | God |
| Geburah | Elohim Gibor | God of Strength |
| Tiphareth | [[YHVH Eloah va-Daath]] | Lord God of Knowledge |
| Netzach | [[YHVH Tzabaoth]] | Lord of Hosts |
| Hod | [[Elohim Tzabaoth]] | God of Hosts |
| Yesod | [[Shaddai El Chai]] | Almighty Living God |
| Malkuth | [[Adonai ha-Aretz]] | Lord of the Earth |

See [[Divine Names]] for the complete overview.

## The Sephiroth and the Tarot

Each Sephirah corresponds to a **number** in the Minor Arcana — the four cards of that number across all suits express the Sephirah's energy in four elemental modes ([[Four Worlds|the Four Worlds]]):

| Number | Sephirah | Wands (Fire) | Cups (Water) | Swords (Air) | Pentacles (Earth) |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 (Ace) | Kether | Root of Fire | Root of Water | Root of Air | Root of Earth |
| 2 | Chokmah | Dominion | Love | Peace | Change |
| 3 | Binah | Virtue | Abundance | Sorrow | Works |
| 4 | Chesed | Completion | Luxury | Truce | Power |
| 5 | Geburah | Strife | Disappointment | Defeat | Worry |
| 6 | Tiphareth | Victory | Pleasure | Science | Success |
| 7 | Netzach | Valour | Debauch | Futility | Failure |
| 8 | Hod | Swiftness | Indolence | Interference | Prudence |
| 9 | Yesod | Strength | Happiness | Cruelty | Gain |
| 10 | Malkuth | Oppression | Satiety | Ruin | Wealth |

The progression tells a story: the pure potential of the Aces (Kether) polarizes into the Twos (Chokmah), takes form in the Threes (Binah), stabilizes in the Fours (Chesed), is disrupted in the Fives (Geburah), finds harmony in the Sixes (Tiphareth), overextends in the Sevens (Netzach), crystallizes in the Eights (Hod), crystallizes further in the Nines (Yesod), and manifests fully — for better or worse — in the Tens (Malkuth).

## The Qlippothic Shadows

Each Sephirah has a corresponding [[Qlippoth|Qlippah]] — its shadow, its pathological expression:

| Sephirah | Qlippah | Distortion |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Kether | Thaumiel | Unity → duality, inflation |
| Chokmah | Ghagiel | Wisdom → cunning |
| Binah | Satariel | Understanding → concealment |
| Chesed | Gamchicoth | Mercy → indulgence |
| Geburah | [[Golachab]] | Severity → cruelty |
| Tiphareth | Tagiriron | Beauty → pride |
| Netzach | A'arab Zaraq | Victory → lust |
| Hod | Samael | Splendor → deception |
| Yesod | Gamaliel | Foundation → corruption |
| Malkuth | Lilith/Nehemoth | Kingdom → exile |

See [[Qlippoth]] for the full entry on the shadow Tree.

## Jungian Parallels

The Sephiroth as a system correspond to Jung's model of the **structured psyche** — a totality that is not chaotic but organized around a center (the Self/Kether), articulated through complementary opposites (the Pillars), and oriented toward a goal (individuation as the Serpent's ascent).[^4]

The critical insight: the Sephiroth are not *things* but **processes** — modes of divine activity that the psyche mirrors. Chesed is not a place but the *act of being merciful*; Geburah is not a location but the *act of discerning and cutting*. The Tree maps not the furniture of the psyche but its *functions*.

## Notes

[^1]: The triple root of ספר (*saphar*): "to count" (*mispar* = number), "to tell/narrate" (*sippur* = story), "to shine" (*sappir* = sapphire, brilliance). The Sephiroth are simultaneously number, narrative, and light.

[^2]: Sefer Yetzirah 1:4 — "Ten is the number of the ineffable Sephiroth — ten and not nine, ten and not eleven. Understand with wisdom, be wise with understanding."

[^3]: Wang, *The Qabalistic Tarot* — The Lightning Flash as the path of emanation, the Flaming Sword as its image; the zigzag descent from Kether to Malkuth.

[^4]: Jung, CW 9i, 14 — The Self as central archetype around which the psyche organizes; individuation as the progressive integration of complementary opposites.
