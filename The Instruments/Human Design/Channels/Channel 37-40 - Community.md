# Channel 37-40
*Community*

---

## Ra's Definition
According to Ra Uru Hu, the **Channel of Community** is the **bargain of tribal support**—the emotional agreement that creates **family, partnership, and community** through mutual promises of care and provision[^1]. This channel connects the **Solar Plexus** (emotional awareness) to the **Heart (Ego)** (willpower), creating the **emotional-will contract** that binds tribes together.

Ra taught that this channel represents the **part seeking the whole**—no one is complete alone; we need each other for survival, support, and meaning[^4]. This is the bargain: "I will provide for you (Ego), and you will provide for me, and together we form community (emotional bond)."

**"The 37-40 is the marriage channel—not romance, but contract. This is 'I will support you if you support me.' This is the glue of community—emotional bonds backed by willpower and commitment. Without this, tribes fall apart."** — Ra Uru Hu

The keynote is **a part seeking a whole**—the recognition that we are interdependent, and that community requires **emotional connection** and **willful commitment** to sustain.

## I-Ching and Tribal Ego Analysis

**Hexagram 37 (The Family):** Wind above, Fire below—warmth and gentle influence creating family bonds. The recognition that **family (and community) is the organic extension of mutual care**.

**Hexagram 40 (Deliverance):** Thunder above, Water below—release from tension, the end of struggle. Paradoxically, this is the **will to provide** AND the **will to rest alone**. The Ego cannot sustain community continuously—it requires **cycles of engagement and withdrawal**.

**Tribal Ego Circuit Role:** In the Tribal Ego Circuit, 37-40 creates the **emotional-will foundation** for tribal support. This pairs with 21-45 (voice of the tribe), 26-44 (tribal memory), and 19-49 (tribal needs).

**The Bargain Structure:** Gate 37 provides **emotional connection** (affection, care, warmth); Gate 40 provides **willpower to uphold the bargain** (provision, work, commitment). Together, they form **sustainable community** through fair exchange.

## Channel Formation and Dynamics

**Gate 37 (Solar Plexus):** "I feel emotional bonds and care for my community."
**Gate 40 (Ego):** "I have the will to provide and uphold my commitments."
**Channel 37-40:** "I create and sustain community through emotional-will bargains."

**Projected Nature:** This channel **cannot force community or bargains**—it must be **recognized and invited** into tribal support roles. Trying to create community without recognition leads to exhaustion and unfair bargains.

## Strategy, Authority, and Deconditioning

**For Emotional Projectors with 37-40:** Wait for **recognition AND emotional clarity** (wave) before entering bargains. The emotional wave must confirm the bargain is correct, and the recognition must confirm you're valued.

**Shadow Patterns:**
- **Unfair Bargains:** Giving more than you receive, or taking more than you give.
- **Ego Exhaustion:** Promising more than the Ego can sustain, leading to burnout and broken promises.
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Using affection to extract commitment, or using commitment to extract affection.

**Deconditioning:** Learn that **community is a fair exchange**, and that your Ego requires **rest between periods of provision** (Gate 40: Deliverance/Aloneness). Do not commit without recognition and emotional clarity.
