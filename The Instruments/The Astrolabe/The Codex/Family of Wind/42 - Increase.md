# Increase
*Thunder above Wind — Growth through completion*

---

## Core Identity

Increase teaches that genuine growth comes not from grasping but from *completing*—finishing what has been started, bringing cycles to fruition, allowing natural expansion to unfold. Thunder above Wind creates the image of movement above gentle penetration: what has been persistently tended (Wind) reaches the moment of breakthrough (Thunder), and increase arrives not as effort but as result.

In Human Design, Gate 42 anchors in the Sacral Center—the life force generator that powers doing, building, and completing. This gate governs *growth through finishing*—the sacral capacity to sustain effort until the cycle completes. The Collective Abstract Circuit carries this gate's frequency: experiential learning through complete cycles, the wisdom gained only by staying through the entire wave from beginning through middle to end. The 42-53 Channel of Maturation connects Sacral to Root, creating the life force to begin correctly (Gate 53) and the power to finish completely (Gate 42).

Wilhelm writes: "INCREASE. It furthers one to undertake something. It furthers one to cross the great water." The teaching is active: increase requires engagement, movement, the willingness to risk. But the emphasis is on *completing* worthy endeavors, not initiating constantly. The Image states: "Wind and thunder: the image of INCREASE. Thus the superior man: If he sees good, he imitates it; If he has faults, he rids himself of them."

The alchemical image is *Multiplicatio*—the stage where the Philosopher's Stone, once achieved, increases its power through repeated application. Increase recognizes that *completion generates overflow*: when you finish one cycle fully, energy becomes available for the next. The person who completes things has more power than the person who starts a thousand things and finishes none.

### The Hexagram (I-Ching)

Hexagram 42, *I* (Increase), depicts Thunder above Wind—arousing movement above gentle penetration.[^1] This hexagram is the inverse of Hexagram 41 (Decrease): where 41 teaches contraction, 42 teaches expansion. But crucially, increase here is *earned* increase—not windfall but the natural overflow that comes from completing cycles. Wilhelm's Judgment encourages undertaking: "It furthers one to undertake something"—but the Image clarifies *what* to undertake: imitate good, correct faults. Increase comes from aligning with what works, releasing what doesn't, and finishing what you start.

### The Gate (Human Design)

Gate 42 in the Sacral governs the life force to complete—not just begin but *finish*, not just try but *accomplish*. Ra Uru Hu taught that this gate carries "the ability to grow through the completion of cycles"—the recognition that starting ten things and finishing none teaches nothing, while starting one thing and seeing it through teaches everything.[^2] When connected to Gate 53 in the Root, the 42-53 Channel creates *Maturation*—the pressure to begin correctly (53) meets the life force to finish completely (42), creating sustainable growth. The challenge: to resist the cultural addiction to novelty and the emotional impatience that abandons projects midstream.

### The Gene Keys

- **Shadow: Expectation**[^3] — The collapse into demanding specific outcomes; growth becomes frustration when reality doesn't match fantasy. Expectation is the person who starts relationships/projects/ventures with fixed ideas of how they "should" unfold, then abandons them when reality deviates. The Shadow is attachment to result: "I will complete this only if it gives me what I want." The teaching is missed: growth comes from the *process* of completing, not the product.

- **Gift: Detachment** — The capacity to commit to completion *without* attachment to specific outcomes. Detachment is not indifference but *spaciousness*—finishing for the sake of finishing, learning for the sake of learning, growing because growth is what living things do. The gift is the gardener who tends the plant regardless of whether it produces the hoped-for fruit; the artist who completes the work regardless of critical response; the person who finishes because finishing is integrity.

- **Siddhi: Celebration** — The recognition that increase is *already happening*—that growth is not something you achieve but something you *are*. At this frequency, every completion is cause for celebration not because you got what you wanted but because you participated in the universe's fundamental impulse toward expansion. Celebration is the mystic's discovery: that life is endlessly generative, that every ending births new beginning, that the cycle itself is the gift. You stop measuring growth and start embodying it.

## Synthesis Notes

### Family Context

This card belongs to the **Family of Wind** — the gentle foundation. Wind provides the persistent tending, while Thunder above represents the breakthrough moment—the harvest after long cultivation. Increase teaches that growth is *patient*: Wind's gentle penetration over time (months, years) creates the conditions for Thunder's sudden expansion. What appears as overnight success is usually the result of sustained invisible work finally becoming visible.

### Archetypal Resonance

Increase resonates with the **Builder archetype**—not the initiator but the *completer*, the one who sees projects through. In myth, this is Hephaestus, the craftsman god who finishes what he starts despite being unloved by Olympus. In Torah, Bezalel who builds the Tabernacle—patient, skilled, completing the sacred work. The archetype teaches that *finishing is rarer than starting*, that completion is a form of genius, that the world is full of brilliant beginnings and desperately needs more dignified endings.

In Jungian terms, Increase is **individuation through the middle**—the recognition that transformation happens not in dramatic initiations but in the long, unglamorous middle where most people quit. Jung's own decades-long work with patients, with symbols, with self—not flashes of insight but sustained engagement.

### Cross-System Convergence

Increase aligns with Qabalah's **Netzach**—Victory, the sphere of Venus, the endurance that completes through sustained effort. Netzach is not dramatic conquest but patient accumulation. In Tarot, Gate 42 resonates with **The World** (XXI)—the completion of the cycle, the harvest of all that has been learned. Also **Nine of Pentacles**—the prosperity earned through patient cultivation, the garden that finally bears fruit.

## Shadow Aspect

**When Detachment becomes Expectation:** The Sacral life force to complete collapses into demanding specific outcomes; finishing is conditional on getting what you want. The Shadow manifests as the person who abandons projects when they don't yield expected results—the writer who quits when the first book doesn't sell, the entrepreneur who moves to the next venture when the current one requires sustained effort, the person who leaves relationships when the honeymoon phase ends. This is expectation: "I will complete only if completion gives me what I imagined."

The conditioning pattern: "Effort should be rewarded" or "If it's hard, I'm doing it wrong." This creates the addiction to novelty—starting new things feels good, finishing current things feels like grinding. The Not-Self strategy is to chase the dopamine hit of beginnings rather than developing the capacity for middles and ends. The result: a life full of unfinished business, a résumé of two-month commitments, the exhaustion of perpetually starting over because completion was never mastered.

Another Shadow trap: completion as compulsion. If one finishes things out of rigid perfectionism rather than organic readiness, completion becomes joyless duty. This manifests as the person who cannot rest, who must finish everything immediately, whose drive to complete is anxiety rather than care. The underlying wound: that incomplete = unworthy, that you have value only through accomplishment, that being is not enough—only doing counts.

## Oracle Reading

### When This Card Appears

**Core Message:** You are being called to *complete*. Not to start something new, not to pivot to the next shiny thing, but to finish what you have already begun. Increase comes through completion: when you bring a cycle to fruition, energy overflows into the next cycle naturally. But if you abandon midstream, you drain power rather than building it. Check your unfinished business: relationships left hanging, projects half-done, commitments half-kept. Finish something. The growth you seek is waiting on the other side of completion.

**Shadow Warning:** Beware expectation—the demand that completion must yield specific results. If you will only finish when guaranteed the outcome you want, you will finish nothing, because reality rarely conforms to fantasy. Detachment is not indifference; it is *completion for its own sake*. The integrity of finishing what you started. The learning available only by staying through the entire cycle. Equally, beware compulsive finishing—completion as anxiety. If you cannot rest until everything is done, completion has become prison rather than power.

**Gift Invitation:** You have the capacity for *detachment*—the ability to commit to completion without attachment to specific outcomes. You understand that growth comes from the *process* of finishing, not just the product. Your willingness to stay through the middle—the hard part, the boring part, the part where glamour fades and work remains—is rare. This is mastery. Not flashes of brilliance but sustained engagement. Your completed projects have power because you gave them what they needed: your presence through the entire arc. This creates genuine increase: energy freed up, lessons learned, capacity built. You are the Builder. Finish what you start.

**Siddhi Vision:** At the highest octave, you realize that increase is not something you pursue—it is what you *are*. Growth is the universe's fundamental impulse; you are that impulse localized. Celebration is the recognition that every completion is sacred: not because you achieved your goal but because you participated in Life's endless becoming. The cycle itself is the gift—beginning, middle, end, new beginning. You stop measuring outcomes and start *celebrating process*. The mystic's teaching: that the flower doesn't bloom "for" anything; it blooms because blooming is what flowers do. You complete because completing is what living things do. And in that completion, increase overflows—not as reward but as natural consequence. You are the garden. The harvest arrives because you stayed through winter.
