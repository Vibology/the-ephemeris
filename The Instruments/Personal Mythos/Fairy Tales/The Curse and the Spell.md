# The Curse and the Spell

## Overview

**The Curse and the Spell** is one of the most psychologically potent motifs in the fairy tale canon, encoding the pattern of **psychic petrification**—the soul's protective shutdown in response to overwhelming trauma, developmental arrest, or an environment hostile to its nature. Unlike the heroic quest where the protagonist actively battles opposition, the Curse marks a period of **enforced passivity, stuckness, and suspended animation**. The cursed figure (most often the maiden, though occasionally the prince) is frozen in time—turned to stone, locked in sleep, transformed into beast or bird—unable to continue development until the spell is broken by external intervention or the passage of necessary time.

**Marie-Louise von Franz** identifies the curse as the **neurotic complex made manifest**: a part of the psyche becomes rigidified, split off, inaccessible to conscious integration. The cursed individual is "asleep" to their own life, numb to feeling, trapped in repetitive patterns that resemble life but lack vitality. In her analysis of *Sleeping Beauty* (Briar Rose), von Franz writes that the hundred-year sleep represents the **"psychic death-in-life"** required when the ego is too immature to withstand adult consciousness or sexuality. The curse is not punishment but **protection**—the psyche's emergency strategy to preserve the Self when direct engagement would annihilate it.

The **thirteenth godmother** (or uninvited fairy, excluded goddess, forgotten nature principle) is the agent of the curse in many tales. Her exclusion from the christening feast, the wedding banquet, or the royal celebration signals a **repressed feminine principle**—the wild, instinctual, chthonic aspect of the Great Mother that civilized consciousness has rejected. Her curse is **nature avenging its neglect**: when the dark goddess is not honored, she returns to claim her due, often by freezing development at the threshold where her power was first denied.

**Psychological Function:** The curse operates as **repression**, a protective mechanism where the psyche "shuts down" certain capacities (sexuality, assertion, creativity, anger) to survive a toxic or premature developmental demand. The individual becomes a "**frozen child**," waiting in suspended animation until conditions (internal maturation, external support, the "right" relationship) allow for awakening. The spell is both **prison and chrysalis**—it binds, but it also protects the inner life from being devoured before it can ripen.

**Developmental Context:** The Curse motif constellates most powerfully during **puberty and adolescence** (ages 12-18), when the psyche must navigate the perilous passage from childhood to sexual maturity. If the environment is abusive, the mother envious ([[Snow White]]), or the ego too fragile, the curse descends—the young person "goes to sleep," retreating into dissociation, depression, anorexia, or obsessive perfectionism. They are present but absent, visible but unreachable, waiting for the Prince (mature consciousness, higher Animus/Anima, therapeutic intervention) to break the spell.

## Core Symbolism

### The Sleep / Death-in-Life

The most common form of the curse is **enchanted sleep**—Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) pricking her finger on the spindle and falling into a hundred-year slumber, Snow White in the glass coffin, the seven brothers turned to swans who can only become human for fifteen minutes each night.[^1] This is **psychic petrification**: the individual is neither fully alive nor fully dead, frozen at the moment of wounding.

**Symbolically, the sleep represents:**

- **Dissociation** – The ego withdraws from unbearable reality, "checking out" of life while appearing to function
- **The Dead Zone** – Von Franz's term for the psychic space where feeling, desire, and vitality have been numbed or shut down
- **Waiting for maturity** – The inner Self is not yet strong enough to engage the wound, the developmental task, or the world's demands; it must "sleep" until internal ripening completes
- **Protection from premature consciousness** – Sexuality, adult responsibility, or self-awareness offered too soon would shatter the fragile ego; the curse delays awakening until readiness

**In dreams:** Being frozen, unable to move, trapped in glass or stone, watching life from behind a barrier, feeling emotionally numb or "not fully here."

### The Beast Form / Animal Transformation

The second major curse-form is **transformation into animal or monstrous shape**—the Beast in *Beauty and the Beast*, the Frog Prince, the Swan Maiden forced into bird form, the cursed brothers who become ravens. This represents the **soul imprisoned in instinctual, inarticulate, or rejected form**.

**Symbolically, the beast curse represents:**

- **The Shadow in exile** – The civilized self (the Prince) has been split from the instinctual self (the Beast); the curse locks consciousness into the rejected pole
- **Loss of human speech/relationship** – The cursed figure cannot speak their truth (the Little Mermaid loses her voice, the swans cannot speak as birds), cannot form human bonds, cannot be recognized for who they truly are
- **Waiting for acceptance** – The Beast cannot break his own curse; only another's love (the feminine's acceptance of the Shadow, the integration of instinct and Spirit) can restore him
- **The unloved self** – The beast form is the part of Self deemed "too ugly, too much, too monstrous" by family or culture; it waits in exile until someone can love it as it is

**In dreams:** Being unable to speak, appearing as an animal or monster, being rejected for one's appearance, hiding one's true form, shape-shifting involuntarily.

### The Spinning Wheel / Spindle

In *Sleeping Beauty*, the curse is triggered by the **spinning wheel**—the forbidden object hidden away after the thirteenth fairy's curse. The spindle is the **tool of the excluded feminine**, the instrument of weaving, spinning, fate-making.

**Symbolically, the spindle represents:**

- **The Fates (Moirai)** – The three Greek goddesses who spin, measure, and cut the thread of life; the spindle is their tool, the axis of destiny
- **Forbidden knowledge** – The King tries to protect Briar Rose by banning all spindles; this is the **parental prohibition** attempting to forestall fate, but the repressed returns
- **First blood / menstruation** – Briar Rose pricks her finger (first blood) at the threshold of puberty; the spinning wheel is the **portal to sexual maturity**, which the psyche is not yet ready to cross
- **The wound that induces sleep** – Not all wounds demand immediate confrontation; some require withdrawal, dormancy, the "long sleep" of integration before awakening

**Mythological parallel:** The Norns (Norse Fates), the Furies, Clotho/Lachesis/Atropos, the spindle as World Axis.

### The Thirteenth Godmother / Uninvited Fairy

The curse's origin is often the **excluded goddess**—the thirteenth fairy not invited to the christening (only twelve golden plates), the goddess Eris not invited to the wedding (the golden apple of discord), Hel or the dark Norns excluded from the feast. She is the **repressed feminine principle**, the dark pole of [[The Great Mother]] whom civilized consciousness refuses to honor.

**Von Franz's interpretation:** The thirteenth fairy represents **nature itself**—the wild, instinctual, chthonic feminine that cannot be controlled or domesticated. When the parents (ego, society, patriarchal order) try to exclude her (repress instinct, deny the body, control nature), she returns with a curse. The curse is **nature's revenge**: "If you will not honor me, I will claim the child at puberty, at the threshold where my power is undeniable."

**Symbolically, the thirteenth godmother represents:**

- **The excluded one** – Whatever has been repressed, denied, or split off (Shadow, sexuality, wildness, the body, the dark goddess)
- **The number thirteen** – Twelve is the number of completion (zodiac, months, apostles); thirteen is the number beyond order, the **transgressive, the excessive, the uncontrollable**
- **Fate as avenger** – She is not "evil" but **inevitable**; what is denied in consciousness will return through the unconscious, often as fate, symptom, or curse
- **The dark mother** – Contrasted with the twelve "good" fairies (the nurturing, civilized Mother), she is the Terrible Mother—devouring, demanding, enforcing limits

**Cross-cultural variants:** Eris (Greek), Hel (Norse), Lilith (Hebrew), the banished goddess, the scorned crone.

### The Glass Coffin / Tower / Hedge of Thorns

The cursed figure is often **enclosed**—Snow White in the glass coffin, Rapunzel in the tower, Sleeping Beauty behind a hedge of thorns. This is the **container of suspended animation**, the protective barrier that preserves the sleeping Self.

**Symbolically, the enclosure represents:**

- **The chrysalis** – The protected space where invisible transformation occurs; the caterpillar is "dead" but is actually becoming the butterfly
- **The dead zone** – The psychic space cut off from life, feeling, vitality; visible (glass coffin) but unreachable
- **The womb-tomb** – Simultaneously death (frozen, inaccessible) and gestation (preparing for rebirth)
- **Defense against penetration** – The hedge of thorns kills any prince who tries to reach Briar Rose before the hundred years are complete; the curse itself **protects the sleeper from premature awakening**

**In developmental terms:** The adolescent in dissociation, anorexia, or chronic depression is "behind glass"—present but absent, visible but unreachable, waiting for the inner work to complete before they can risk embodiment.

## Psychological Function: Repression as Survival

The curse is **not arbitrary punishment**—it is the **psyche's emergency protocol** when faced with a developmental demand it cannot yet meet. Jung called this the **protective function of neurosis**: the symptom (the sleep, the beast form, the muteness) preserves the Self from annihilation.

### Repression Defined

In Freudian terms, **repression** is the unconscious defense mechanism that banishes unbearable content (memories, desires, traumas) from consciousness. In Jungian terms, repression creates the **complex**—a split-off portion of the psyche that operates autonomously, draining energy from conscious life.

The curse is **repression made literal**: the capacity for feeling, sexuality, agency, or voice is **locked away**, inaccessible, as if under a spell. The individual functions but is not fully present—they are "asleep" to their own life.

**Von Franz:** The curse often descends at **puberty** because this is the threshold where the psyche must integrate sexuality, aggression, and adult consciousness. If the family environment is toxic (envious mother, absent father, abusive household) or the ego is too fragile, the only survival strategy is **shutdown**. The psyche "goes to sleep" rather than shatter.

### The Curse as "Just-So Story"

Von Franz notes that those under a curse often develop a **fated narrative**: "This is just how it is. I was born this way. There's nothing I can do." The curse becomes an explanation, a resignation, a way of avoiding responsibility for one's own awakening.

#### Examples
- "I'm just not a sexual person" (repressed Eros)
- "I've always been this way" (frozen development)
- "No one could ever love me" (the Beast's belief)
- "I can't help it; it's my family curse" (projection of responsibility onto fate)

The curse functions as **psychological determinism**: the individual believes they are powerless to change, that they are fated to remain asleep, beast-formed, or mute until some external savior arrives.

**The therapeutic task:** To recognize the curse as **temporary enchantment, not permanent identity**. The spell can be broken—but it requires conscious engagement, not passive waiting.

### Waiting for Maturity

Not all curses are pathological. Some are **developmentally necessary**. The psyche knows when it is not yet ready and enforces dormancy until internal conditions shift.

**Von Franz:** Briar Rose's hundred-year sleep is not failure—it is **wisdom**. She is fifteen (or sixteen) when cursed; she is not ready for sexuality, marriage, or queenship. The sleep allows her to **mature invisibly**, to ripen in the unconscious, until the time is right. When the Prince arrives, she awakens not as a child but as a **woman, ready for union**.

**Modern application:** The young person in chronic depression, dissociation, or "failure to launch" may be in a **necessary fallow period**. Not all delays are resistance; some are **psychic incubation**. The task is discernment: Is this protective dormancy or pathological avoidance?

### The Dead Zone (Identifying Numbness)

The curse manifests in waking life as **the Dead Zone**—the psychic areas where feeling, desire, and vitality have been shut down.

**Common Dead Zone symptoms:**
- **Anhedonia** – Inability to feel pleasure, joy, or excitement
- **Emotional numbness** – "I don't feel anything" (the sleep as affective flatness)
- **Sexual dissociation** – Inability to feel desire, arousal, or connection during intimacy
- **Creative paralysis** – "I used to write/paint/dream, but I can't anymore"
- **Chronic fatigue** – The body "asleep," perpetually exhausted, unable to mobilize energy
- **Spectating one's life** – Watching oneself from behind glass, going through motions but not present

**The curse question:** "Where in my life am I asleep? What part of me is frozen, waiting to be awakened?"

## Examples Across Tales

### Sleeping Beauty (Briar Rose) – The Primary Curse Tale

**The curse:** The thirteenth fairy, excluded from the christening, curses the infant princess to prick her finger on a spindle at age fifteen and die. A twelfth fairy softens the curse: she will not die but sleep for one hundred years, until a prince awakens her.

**Psychological reading:**
- **Puberty as perilous threshold** – Briar Rose is fifteen when she pricks her finger (first blood, menarche); the curse descends at the moment of sexual maturation
- **The excluded feminine strikes** – The thirteenth fairy is nature, the wild feminine, the body; her exclusion is the family's denial of sexuality, instinct, the dark goddess
- **The sleep as protection** – Briar Rose is not ready for adult sexuality; the hundred-year sleep allows her to mature invisibly, to ripen in the unconscious
- **The hedge of thorns** – Kills any prince who tries to awaken her prematurely; the curse itself protects the sleeper from violation
- **Awakening when ready** – After exactly one hundred years, the hedge parts, the prince enters, and she awakens at the first kiss. The timing is **not arbitrary**—it is the psyche's own clock, signaling readiness

**Modern parallel:** The adolescent girl who "shuts down" at puberty—becomes withdrawn, depressed, anorexic, or dissociative—to avoid the overwhelming demands of sexuality, the mother's envy ([[Snow White]]), or the culture's predatory gaze. She is "asleep" until conditions allow for safe awakening.

### Beauty and the Beast – The Beast Curse

**The curse:** A vain, cruel prince scorns an old woman (a disguised enchantress); she curses him to live as a Beast until a woman loves him in his monstrous form. His servants are also transformed (into furniture, objects), and a rose blooms as a timer—if he does not win love before the last petal falls, the curse becomes permanent.

**Psychological reading:**
- **The beast as Shadow** – The Prince (conscious ego, civilized Spirit) has been severed from the Beast (instinct, body, sexuality, the unloved self)
- **Vanity as the crime** – The Prince valued appearance over essence, surface over soul; the curse forces him to discover whether anyone can love him for **what he is, not how he appears**
- **Waiting for love as alchemy** – The Beast cannot break his own curse; he requires the **feminine's acceptance** (Beauty's love). This is integration through relationship, not solo conquest
- **The rose as Eros** – Beauty asks for a rose (soul, beauty, life) rather than jewels (material wealth); the rose is the trigger of fate and the symbol of the work's completion
- **Transformation through being seen** – When Beauty loves the Beast **as Beast** (not after he becomes the Prince), the spell shatters. The curse breaks when the shadow is accepted, not when it is cleaned up

**Modern parallel:** The man (or woman) who believes he is "unlovable" in his raw, instinctual, imperfect self; who performs the Prince (polished persona, achievement, control) while hiding the Beast (need, vulnerability, desire). The curse is broken when someone **sees and loves the beast-self**, allowing integration.

### Snow White – The Poisoned Apple Curse

**The curse:** The Evil Queen (envious stepmother) offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White bites the red half and falls into a death-like sleep. The dwarfs cannot revive her; she is placed in a glass coffin on a mountaintop. A prince finds her, takes the coffin, and a jolt dislodges the apple from her throat, awakening her.

**Psychological reading:**
- **The poisoned gift** – The apple is **false knowledge, premature sexuality, or the mother's projection**. It appears beautiful but carries death. The curse is disguised as a gift.
- **The apple lodged in the throat** – The throat is the place of voice, of Self-expression. The poison **silences** Snow White, preventing her from speaking her truth or claiming her life
- **The glass coffin as dissociation** – Snow White is visible but unreachable, preserved but not alive. This is the **anorexic fantasy**: perfect, frozen, untouched by life's messiness
- **The curse as maternal envy** – The Queen cannot bear Snow White's blossoming; the curse is the **mother's refusal to yield**, the old order refusing to give way to the new
- **Awakening by expulsion, not digestion** – The apple is **dislodged, not integrated**. Some poisons must be rejected, not metabolized. The curse is broken when the false consciousness (the Queen's projection) is expelled

**Modern parallel:** The daughter who internalizes the mother's envy, the culture's demands, or early abuse as a "curse"—a poisoned belief that she is "too much, too beautiful, too alive" and must therefore diminish herself. She "goes to sleep" (dissociates, develops eating disorders, becomes invisible) until the poison is recognized and expelled.

### The Frog Prince – The Curse of Rejected Form

**The curse:** A prince is transformed into a frog (versions vary on the cause—often a witch's spell). He can only be restored to human form through the love or action of a maiden. The princess throws him against the wall (violence, disgust), and he transforms instantly into a prince.

**Psychological reading:**
- **The frog as rejected Shadow** – The slimy, cold-blooded, repulsive aspect of self; the part deemed "too ugly" to love
- **The golden ball in the well** – The Self (the golden ball) has fallen into the unconscious (the well); only the frog (the Shadow) can retrieve it
- **The princess's disgust** – The ego's resistance to integration: "I don't want to touch that, eat with that, sleep beside that"
- **The transformation as violent** – In the Grimm version, the frog is not kissed but **thrown**. The force of the impact (the decisiveness of confrontation) breaks the spell instantly
- **The marriage** – The union of conscious (princess) and unconscious (frog/prince). The curse is broken not by gentle acceptance but by **forceful engagement**

**Modern parallel:** The part of self one finds "disgusting" (neediness, rage, sexuality, the body) must be **claimed, not coddled**. The curse breaks when the ego stops trying to avoid the Shadow and instead **confronts it directly**, even violently.

### The Seven Swans / Six Swans – The Silence Curse

**The curse:** Seven (or six) brothers are transformed into swans by a wicked stepmother or witch. Their sister must remain **silent for seven years** (or weave shirts from nettles while remaining mute) to break the spell. If she speaks a single word before completing the task, the curse becomes permanent.

**Psychological reading:**
- **The silence as ordeal** – The feminine (the sister) must endure years of enforced muteness, often while being accused, threatened, or nearly killed. The curse can only be broken through **sustained, disciplined engagement**, not instant revelation
- **The brothers as lost masculine** – The positive animus figures (brothers, helpers) have been "cursed away" into animal form; the feminine must labor in silence to restore them
- **The nettle shirts** – The nettles sting, burn, wound; the work of integration is painful, repetitive, solitary. The curse is not broken by heroic action but by **patient endurance**
- **The prohibition on speech** – The ego must not "explain itself," justify, or seek external validation. The work occurs in silence, in the depths, away from the world's judgment
- **Partial transformation** – Often one brother remains partially swan (one arm still a wing) because the final shirt was incomplete. This is the **scar of the curse**: integration is never perfect; some wounding remains

**Modern parallel:** The therapeutic process that requires **years of silent inner work** (analysis, somatic therapy, meditation) to restore lost parts of self. The temptation to "speak too soon" (explain, justify, seek approval) can abort the transformation.

---

## Developmental Significance: Frozen Development & Stuck Patterns

The curse motif is intimately tied to **developmental arrest**—the psyche frozen at the moment of wounding, unable to mature beyond that point.

### Puberty as the Perilous Threshold

**The majority of curse tales target puberty** (ages 12-16):
- Sleeping Beauty is cursed at birth but the curse descends at fifteen (menarche, first blood)
- Snow White is seven when she flees the Queen but enters the glass coffin in adolescence
- The Little Mermaid is fifteen when she makes her bargain and loses her voice
- Rapunzel is twelve when locked in the tower

**Why puberty?** Because this is the threshold where the psyche must integrate:
- **Sexuality and the body** – The shift from child to sexual being
- **Separation from parents** – Individuation, leaving the "nest"
- **Adult consciousness** – Responsibility, moral complexity, the end of innocence

If the environment is hostile (abusive, envious, or simply unequipped to support this transition), the psyche may **"curse itself"**—shut down sexuality, dissociate from the body, freeze development at the pre-pubertal stage. The young person becomes the Sleeping Beauty, the Snow White in glass, the silent swan-maiden.

### The Stuck Pattern (Just-So Story)

Those living under a curse often develop **rigid, repetitive patterns** that resist change:

#### Examples
- The woman who "cannot" feel sexual desire (repressed Eros, frozen at the moment of wounding)
- The man who remains in perpetual adolescence, unable to commit or claim adult responsibility (the Peter Pan curse)
- The individual who repeats the same relational pattern (choosing unavailable partners, sabotaging intimacy) as if under a spell
- The creative who "cannot" create, despite longing to (the Muse has been cursed away)

**Von Franz:** The curse becomes the **explanation and the excuse**: "I was cursed. I can't help it. This is just how I am." The individual abdicates agency, waiting for the prince, the fairy godmother, or the right spell-breaker to arrive.

**The therapeutic intervention:** To recognize the "just-so story" as **narrative, not ontology**. The curse is not who you are—it is something that happened to you. And spells, by their nature, **can be broken**.

### Waiting for the Prince (Passivity vs. Agency)

A common critique of curse tales is that they **glorify passivity**: the maiden does nothing but sleep and wait for the prince to rescue her. But von Franz argues this misreads the psychology.

**When passivity is appropriate:**
- The ego is too fragile to fight (Snow White cannot battle the Queen directly at age seven; she would be destroyed)
- The environment is too toxic to engage (fleeing to the forest, "playing dead" in the glass coffin, is survival wisdom)
- The inner work requires **time, not action** (Sleeping Beauty's hundred-year sleep is the psyche's incubation period; rushing awakening would abort the process)

**When passivity becomes pathological:**
- The individual remains "asleep" past the point of readiness (waiting for rescue when they could awaken themselves)
- The curse is used as an excuse to avoid responsibility ("I can't change; I'm cursed")
- The prince is expected to "fix" the sleeper, rather than being the **catalyst** for a transformation the sleeper must complete

**The discernment:** Is the sleep protective (necessary fallow period) or avoidant (refusal to engage life)? Is the waiting receptive (allowing the psyche to ripen) or passive (abdicating agency)?

## Jungian Analysis: The Complex, the Shadow, and the Dead Zone

### The Curse as Complex

In Jung's model, a **complex** is a split-off portion of the psyche that operates autonomously, draining energy from conscious life. Complexes form around wounds, traumas, or repressed material and "constellate" (take over) when triggered.

**The curse is the complex made literal:**
- The Beast is the **animus complex**—the rejected masculine within, cursed into monstrous form
- Sleeping Beauty's hundred-year sleep is the **mother complex**—the psyche frozen in the maternal unconscious, unable to separate
- Snow White's poisoned apple is the **negative mother complex**—the internalized voice of envy, criticism, or shame that "poisons" the ego's capacity for joy or vitality
- The silent swan-brothers are the **lost animus**—the inner masculine helpers cursed away, leaving the ego without drive, direction, or protection

**Breaking the curse = integrating the complex.** The complex must be consciously engaged, related to, and integrated. It cannot be "killed" (the Beast must not be slain) or avoided (Sleeping Beauty cannot sleep forever). The curse demands **relationship**.

### The Repressed Feminine Strikes (The Thirteenth Godmother)

The **thirteenth godmother** is the quintessential representation of the **repressed feminine**—the dark pole of [[The Great Mother]], the wild instinctual nature that civilized consciousness (the King, the ego, the patriarchal order) attempts to exclude.

**Von Franz's reading:** The King in Sleeping Beauty tries to protect Briar Rose by **banning all spindles** (repressing the tool of the Fates, the instrument of the dark feminine). This is the ego's fantasy: "If I control the environment, I can prevent fate." But **what is repressed in consciousness returns through the unconscious**, often as symptom, fate, or curse.

The thirteenth fairy's curse is **nature's revenge**: "You tried to exclude me, to deny my power, to pretend I do not exist. I will claim the child at puberty, at the threshold where my reality is undeniable."

**Psychologically:** The family that denies sexuality, demonizes the body, or represses instinct is setting the stage for the curse. The child internalizes the repression, and at puberty (when the body and sexuality can no longer be denied), the **curse descends**—eating disorders, dissociation, sexual dysfunction, depression.

**The antidote:** Honor the thirteenth godmother. Invite her to the feast. Acknowledge the dark feminine, the body, the instincts, the shadow. What is consciously honored does not need to curse.

### The Dead Zone (Shadow Work Application)

The curse manifests as the **Dead Zone**—the psychic areas where vitality, feeling, and aliveness have been shut down. Von Franz describes this as the regions of the psyche that are "asleep," inaccessible to conscious engagement.

**Identifying the Dead Zone:**

Ask yourself:
- *Where in my life do I feel numb, frozen, or "under a spell"?*
- *What desires, feelings, or capacities have I "put to sleep" to survive?*
- *Where do I tell myself "I can't" when the truth is "I'm afraid to"?*
- *What part of me is waiting for permission, rescue, or the "right time" to awaken?*

**Common Dead Zones:**
- **Sexuality** – "I just don't feel desire" (repressed Eros)
- **Anger** – "I'm not an angry person" (rage frozen to preserve relationships)
- **Creativity** – "I used to write/paint/dream, but I can't anymore" (the Muse cursed away)
- **Joy** – Anhedonia, inability to feel pleasure (the heart asleep)
- **Ambition** – "I don't want anything" (desire repressed to avoid disappointment)

**The therapeutic work:** To name the curse ("I realize I've been asleep in this area"), to identify its origin (the wound, the trauma, the prohibition), and to consciously engage the awakening (therapy, somatic work, creative practice, relational risk).

---

## Von Franz Interpretation: Nature Avenging, The Excluded Godmother

**Marie-Louise von Franz** devotes extensive analysis to the curse motif in *The Interpretation of Fairy Tales* and *The Feminine in Fairy Tales*. Her core insights:

### The Thirteenth Fairy as Nature Principle

Von Franz identifies the excluded thirteenth fairy as **nature itself**—the wild, instinctual, uncontrollable aspect of the feminine that cannot be domesticated or rationalized. The King's attempt to "protect" Briar Rose by banning spindles is the **ego's futile attempt to control fate, to deny nature, to prevent the inevitable**.

But **nature cannot be excluded**. What is repressed returns. The thirteenth fairy ensures that Briar Rose will encounter the spindle (puberty, sexuality, the body, the dark goddess) at exactly the moment when the psyche can no longer avoid it.

**The curse is nature's teaching:** "You cannot skip this threshold. You cannot rationalize away the body, the instincts, the shadow. I will force you to confront what you have denied."

### The Spell as Protective, Not Punitive

Von Franz emphasizes that the curse is **not punishment**—it is **protection**. Briar Rose is fifteen when she pricks her finger; she is not yet ready for sexuality, marriage, or queenship. The twelfth fairy (the conscious feminine, the good mother) **softens the curse** from death to sleep, recognizing that what the psyche cannot integrate must be **postponed, not destroyed**.

The hundred-year sleep is the psyche's way of saying: "Not yet. You need time. I will preserve you in dormancy until you are ready."

**Modern application:** Not all developmental delays are pathological. Some young people need extended "latency" (remaining in the forest with the dwarfs, sleeping in the tower, staying home past eighteen) because their inner work is not complete. The task is **discernment**: Is this protective dormancy or avoidant stagnation?

### The Hedge of Thorns (The Curse Protects the Sleeper)

Von Franz notes that the **hedge of thorns** around Sleeping Beauty's castle is part of the curse's protective function. Any prince who tries to penetrate the hedge before the hundred years are complete is **killed**, tangled in thorns, unable to reach the sleeping maiden.

This is the psyche's **defense against premature awakening**:
- The adolescent girl who dissociates or becomes anorexic is "behind thorns"—anyone who tries to "wake her up" (force her into sexuality, relationship, or embodiment) before she is ready will be "killed" (rejected, pushed away, met with rage or collapse)
- The man frozen in the Beast-form cannot be "fixed" by force; he must be met with patience, acceptance, love **as he is**

**The hedge parts only when the time is right.** At the end of exactly one hundred years, the prince walks through the hedge effortlessly—the thorns part, the roses bloom. This is **grace, not conquest**. The awakening cannot be forced; it must be **received at the right time**.

### The Curse as "Just-So Story" of Fated Stagnation

Von Franz warns against the **just-so story** that develops around curses: "This is just how it is. I was born this way. There's nothing I can do."

#### Examples
- "I'm just not a sexual person" (repressed Eros naturalized as identity)
- "I've always been depressed" (the curse as fate, not symptom)
- "No one in my family has ever been happy" (the family curse as determinism)

The curse becomes an **explanation that forecloses agency**: "I'm under a spell. I can't change. I'm waiting for the prince."

**Von Franz's challenge:** The curse is **temporary enchantment, not eternal identity**. The spell can be broken—but it requires **conscious engagement, not passive waiting**. The prince is a catalyst, not a savior. The sleeper must do the inner work of awakening.

---

## Alchemical Correspondences: Coagulatio (Fixation) and Solutio (Dissolving)

The curse motif maps directly onto the alchemical operations of **Coagulatio** (fixation, stuckness) and **Solutio** (dissolution, release).

### Coagulatio: The Curse as Petrification

**[[Coagulation]]** in alchemy is the solidification of matter—milk into cheese, liquid metal into ingot, spirit into stone. In its shadow form, Coagulatio is **premature rigidity**: the psyche "solidifying" before the work is complete, freezing into fixed patterns.

**The curse is pathological Coagulatio:**
- The individual is **turned to stone** (literally, in some tales; psychologically, in life)
- Feeling, desire, and vitality are **frozen**
- The psyche becomes **rigid, repetitive, stuck**
- Time itself seems to stop (Sleeping Beauty's hundred-year sleep; the enchanted castle where nothing ages)

**Symptoms of curse-Coagulatio:**
- Chronic depression (emotional petrification)
- Obsessive patterns (the same relational dynamic, over and over)
- Inability to change ("I've always been this way")
- Dissociation (the body frozen, the self "turned to stone")

**The alchemical antidote:** [[Dissolution]]—the water that dissolves the stone, the tears that melt the frozen heart, the emotional release that breaks the rigidity.

### Solutio: Breaking the Spell

**[[Dissolution]]** in alchemy is the dissolving of solid matter in water—ash into liquid, salt into brine, the rigid ego into the waters of the unconscious. Solutio is the **release**, the melting, the surrender to flow.

**The spell is broken through Solutio:**
- **Beauty's tears** dissolve the Beast's curse (water as solvent, grief as alchemy)
- **The Prince's kiss** awakens Sleeping Beauty (love as the water that dissolves the sleep)
- **The dislodged apple** from Snow White's throat (expelling the poison, releasing the stuck breath)
- **The nettle shirts** woven with tears and silence (water and discipline together)

**Psychologically, the spell-breaking Solutio is:**
- **Emotional release** – The tears that finally come after years of numbness
- **Grief** – Mourning what was lost during the "sleep"
- **Therapy** – The relational container where the frozen parts can thaw
- **Love** – The acceptance (from self or other) that melts the defensive rigidity

**The formula:** Curse = pathological Coagulatio. Spell-breaking = conscious Solutio. The frozen must be **dissolved** before it can be **reconstituted** (healthy Coagulatio, integration).

## Tarot Parallels: The Devil (Bondage) and The Moon (Bewitchment)

### The Devil (Key XV): Bondage and Illusion

**[[The Devil (XV)]]** in the Tarot depicts two figures chained to a pedestal where the Devil sits. The chains are loose—the figures could remove them, but they do not. This is the **bondage of illusion**, the curse of believing oneself to be powerless.

**The Devil as curse motif:**
- **The chains are loose** – The curse is often **self-perpetuating illusion**. "I can't leave. I can't change. I'm trapped." But the chains can be removed at any time.
- **Addiction and compulsion** – The Devil represents the patterns we repeat compulsively, as if under a spell (substance abuse, toxic relationships, self-sabotage)
- **The shadow of materialism** – Being "cursed" into identification with the body, the persona, the material world, unable to access spirit
- **The false belief in powerlessness** – "I'm under a spell. I can't help it." The Devil asks: *Are you, or have you chosen the chains?*

**Breaking the Devil-curse:** Recognizing the **illusion of bondage**. The moment you realize the chains are removable, you are free. The curse loses power when its nature (self-imposed, maintained by belief) is seen.

**Fairy tale parallel:** The Beast who believes he is unlovable, the Sleeping Beauty who believes she cannot wake, the Snow White who believes the poison is permanent. The curse is sustained by **belief**, not external force.

### The Moon (Key XVIII): Enchantment and Illusion

**[[The Moon (XVIII)]]** depicts a path leading between two towers toward distant mountains, with a crayfish emerging from water, a dog and wolf howling, and a glowing moon above. The card represents **illusion, enchantment, the twilight realm where the unconscious rules**.

**The Moon as curse motif:**
- **Bewitchment** – Being "under the Moon's spell," lost in fantasy, illusion, or the unconscious
- **The dream-state** – Sleeping Beauty's hundred-year sleep is lunar (night, unconscious, the feminine mystery)
- **The path through danger** – The Moon's path is guarded by the dog (domesticated instinct) and wolf (wild instinct); the journey through enchantment is perilous
- **The crayfish (the Deep Dweller)** – The unconscious creature that drags the ego into the depths (the curse pulling the individual into sleep, regression, or madness)
- **Illusion vs. revelation** – The Moon can deceive (false appearances, enchantment) or reveal (the hidden, the unconscious, the soul's truth)

**Breaking the Moon-curse:** Walking the path **through** the illusion, not around it. The Moon's spell is broken by **conscious engagement with the unconscious** (therapy, dreamwork, active imagination), not by denial or force.

**Fairy tale parallel:** The enchanted forest, the hedge of thorns, the spell-bound castle—all are lunar realms where time stops, logic fails, and the unconscious rules. The hero must **pass through** (not conquer) to reach awakening.

---

## Cross-Cultural Variants: Swan Maidens, Selkie Seal-Skins, and Stolen Voices

The curse motif appears across all cultures, often as **stolen form** or **captured essence**—the soul imprisoned in animal shape or robbed of its true nature.

### The Swan Maiden / Selkie (Celtic, Norse, Slavic)

**The tale:** A man discovers a maiden bathing in a lake. She has shed her swan-skin (or seal-skin) and is in human form. He steals the skin and hides it, forcing her to remain human and marry him. Years pass; she finds the hidden skin, reclaims it, and returns to the water or sky, leaving the husband and children behind.

**The curse:**
- **The stolen skin** – The woman's true nature (wild, instinctual, free) is hidden from her; she is "cursed" to live in domesticated human form
- **The captive wife** – She appears to consent, to love, to be a good mother—but she is **not free**. Her soul is in exile.
- **The return to the wild** – The moment she finds the skin, she leaves. The curse is broken; the true self reclaimed.

**Psychological reading:**
- The skin is the **authentic self**, the wild feminine, the soul's true form
- The husband is the **ego, the patriarchal order, the domesticating force** that tries to control or possess the wild
- The marriage is the **false life**, the persona-performance, the self in exile
- The return to the water/sky is **individuation**, reclaiming the soul from captivity

**Modern parallel:** The woman who "loses herself" in marriage, motherhood, or career—her "skin" (authentic self) hidden, her wild nature repressed. The curse is broken when she **reclaims her skin** (leaves the marriage, quits the job, stops performing, returns to her soul's work).

### The Little Mermaid's Stolen Voice (Hans Christian Andersen)

**The tale:** The Little Mermaid trades her voice (her tongue cut out) to the Sea Witch in exchange for legs, hoping to win the love of a human prince. Unable to speak, she cannot tell him who she is or express her truth. The prince marries another. The mermaid is given a choice: kill the prince and return to the sea, or dissolve into sea foam. She chooses dissolution.

**The curse:**
- **The stolen voice** – The mermaid's authentic expression, her song, her truth, is **severed**. She is mute, unable to speak her desire or identity.
- **The false self** – She tries to live as human (the false form) but cannot speak, cannot be known, cannot be loved for who she is
- **Dissolution as liberation** – Unable to live as human or return to mermaid-form, she dissolves into sea foam (in some versions, becoming a "daughter of the air," a purified spirit)

**Psychological reading:**
- The voice is the **authentic self-expression**, the soul's song
- The prince is the **animus projection**—the idealized masculine onto whom the mermaid projects her hope for completion
- The muteness is the **curse of self-betrayal**: she gives up her truth to pursue external validation
- The dissolution is **ego-death**—neither the false self (human) nor the old self (mermaid) can continue; a third thing (daughter of air) must emerge

**Modern parallel:** The person who "loses their voice" to please others—who stops speaking their truth, stops creating, stops singing their soul's song. The curse is broken when the voice is **reclaimed** (speaking truth, creating again, refusing to perform silence).

### The Frog Prince / East of the Sun, West of the Moon (Animal Bridegroom Tales)

**The tale:** A prince is cursed into animal form (frog, bear, serpent) and can only be restored through a maiden's love, acceptance, or specific ritual (a kiss, breaking a taboo, enduring a trial).

**The curse:**
- **The beast form** – The masculine (animus, prince, self) is trapped in rejected, instinctual, or monstrous shape
- **The waiting** – The cursed figure cannot break his own spell; he requires the **feminine's intervention** (love, acceptance, conscious engagement)
- **The prohibition** – Often the maiden must not look at the prince, must not speak, must not ask questions. Breaking the prohibition prolongs or worsens the curse (Psyche and Eros, Bluebeard).

**Psychological reading:**
- The animal bridegroom is the **shadow-animus**, the rejected masculine within (for women) or the split-off instinctual self (for men)
- The curse is **dissociation**: spirit (prince) severed from instinct (beast)
- The maiden's task is **integration**: to love the shadow, to accept the beast, to engage the rejected rather than flee

**Modern parallel:** The man who believes his instinctual, needy, vulnerable self is "unlovable" and performs the polished prince (persona) while hiding the beast (shadow). The curse is broken when he allows himself to be **seen and loved in his beastliness**.

## Shadow Work Applications: Identifying Numbness, Naming the Curse

The curse motif offers a powerful framework for **shadow work**—identifying where the psyche has "gone to sleep," frozen, or been enchanted into stuckness.

### Identifying Where You Are Asleep (The Dead Zone)

**Exercise: The Sleeping Beauty Inventory**

Ask yourself:
1. *Where in my life do I feel numb, frozen, or "under a spell"?*
   - Sexuality? Creativity? Ambition? Joy? Anger? Grief?
2. *What desires, feelings, or capacities have I "put to sleep" to survive?*
   - "I used to want _____, but I don't anymore."
   - "I used to feel _____, but now I'm numb."
3. *Where do I tell myself "I can't" when the truth is "I'm afraid to"?*
   - "I can't leave this relationship." (Fear of being alone?)
   - "I can't pursue that dream." (Fear of failure? Fear of success?)
4. *What part of me is waiting for permission, rescue, or the "right time" to awaken?*
   - "When I find the right partner, then I'll…"
   - "When my parents die, then I'll…"
   - "When I'm healed, then I'll…"

**The curse question:** *What spell am I under? What false belief keeps me asleep?*

Common spells:
- "I'm not _____ enough" (attractive, smart, worthy)
- "It's too late for me"
- "This is just how I am"
- "I was born this way; I can't change"
- "My family is cursed; I'm fated to repeat their patterns"

**The antidote:** Name the spell. The moment you identify the belief as a **spell** (not truth, not fate), its power begins to dissolve.

### Naming Family and Cultural Curses

The curse is often **intergenerational**—passed down through family lines as trauma, prohibition, or unconscious belief.

**Exercise: The Family Curse Inventory**

Ask yourself:
1. *What was forbidden in my family?*
   - Anger? Sexuality? Ambition? Joy? Creativity? Vulnerability?
2. *What beliefs did I inherit that feel like a "curse"?*
   - "No one in our family has ever been happy."
   - "We're cursed in love."
   - "Success is dangerous; it will destroy you."
   - "Your body is shameful; hide it."
3. *What happened to those who broke the family rules?*
   - Were they shamed, exiled, or scapegoated?
4. *What part of me did I "curse" (repress, shut down) to belong to my family?*

**The therapeutic task:** To recognize the family curse as **inherited enchantment, not personal destiny**. You are not fated to repeat the pattern. The spell can be broken.

**Breaking the family curse:**
- **Name it** – "I realize I've been living under the belief that _____."
- **Trace its origin** – "This belief came from my mother/father/culture, not from me."
- **Reject it** – "This is not my curse. I release it."
- **Reclaim the exiled part** – "I reclaim the part of me that was forbidden."

### Reclaiming the Stolen Skin (Authenticity Work)

For those living in a **false self** (performing the domesticated swan, the silent mermaid, the polished prince), the work is to **reclaim the stolen skin**—the authentic self hidden or repressed.

**Exercise: The Selkie Retrieval**

1. **Identify the stolen skin** – What part of your authentic self have you hidden, repressed, or "given up" to belong, to be loved, to be safe?
   - Your wildness? Your voice? Your sexuality? Your creativity? Your anger?
2. **Who took the skin?** – Who demanded you hide your true nature?
   - A parent? A partner? A religion? A culture? Yourself (internalized oppressor)?
3. **Where is the skin hidden?** – Where in your psyche or life have you buried the authentic self?
   - In the attic (repressed memories, childhood dreams)?
   - In the basement (shadow, shame, the "too much" parts)?
   - In the locked drawer (the secret desires, the forbidden longings)?
4. **Reclaim the skin** – Consciously retrieve the lost part.
   - Write a letter to the hidden self: "I'm coming for you. I'm bringing you home."
   - Enact the return: Take a class, start a project, speak a truth, leave a situation that demands you stay small.
5. **Put on the skin** – Embody the reclaimed self.
   - Dance, create, speak, love, rage—whatever the skin allows.
   - Accept that putting on the skin may mean **leaving the marriage, the job, the identity** that required you to be skinless.

**The risk:** Reclaiming the skin often means losing the "husband" (the life, the relationship, the identity built on the false self). The Selkie cannot stay human once she finds her skin. This is **liberation, not tragedy**.

## Practical Exercises: Breaking the Spell

### 1. The Curse-Breaking Ritual

**Materials:** Paper, pen, bowl of water, candle

**Steps:**
1. **Name the curse** – Write down the belief, pattern, or frozen state that feels like a spell.
   - "I am cursed to be alone."
   - "I am frozen in fear."
   - "My voice has been stolen."
2. **Identify its origin** – Where did this curse come from? Who cast it?
   - "My mother's envy cursed me into invisibility."
   - "The culture's gaze cursed me into the glass coffin (anorexia, perfectionism)."
   - "My own fear cursed me into the beast-form (shame, hiding)."
3. **Speak the counter-spell** – Aloud, declare the curse broken.
   - "This is not my fate. This spell has no power over me. I am awake. I am free."
4. **Burn the paper** – Light the paper with the candle, letting it burn completely. As it burns, visualize the curse dissolving.
5. **Wash your hands** – Dip your hands in the bowl of water, washing away the ashes. The water is the Solutio, the dissolving agent.
6. **Embody the awakening** – Do one thing today that the curse forbade.
   - If you were "cursed to be silent," speak a difficult truth.
   - If you were "frozen in fear," take one risk.
   - If you were "cursed to be invisible," be seen.

### 2. The Sleeping Beauty Awakening

**For those in the "hundred-year sleep" (dissociation, numbness, chronic depression):**

1. **Honor the sleep** – Do not shame yourself for the dormancy. The sleep was protective. Thank it: "You kept me safe when I was too fragile to engage. Thank you."
2. **Assess readiness** – Ask: "Am I still too fragile, or am I ready to awaken?"
   - If too fragile: Honor the need for more time. Do the inner work (therapy, somatic healing, building internal resources) until readiness arrives.
   - If ready: Proceed.
3. **Invoke the kiss** – The "prince's kiss" is the catalyst for awakening. This can be:
   - A relationship that calls you back into embodiment
   - A life crisis that breaks the trance
   - A therapeutic intervention (EMDR, somatic therapy, psychedelics)
   - A conscious decision: "I choose to wake up."
4. **Break the glass** – The glass coffin must be shattered. Take one action that brings you back into the world of the living:
   - Leave the house, go to a place where life is loud and messy
   - Reach out to someone you've been avoiding
   - Start creating again (write, paint, dance)
   - Feel something fully (cry, rage, laugh until you ache)
5. **Return to the kingdom** – Awakening is not enough; you must **live the awakening**. Sleeping Beauty doesn't stay in the tower—she returns to rule. Embody your authority, your desires, your life.

### 3. The Beast Integration (Shadow Work)

**For those cursed into beast-form (the unloved, rejected self):**

1. **Name your Beast** – What part of you feels monstrous, unlovable, or shameful?
   - Your anger? Your neediness? Your sexuality? Your ambition? Your body?
2. **Meet the Beast** – In active imagination, sit with the Beast. Let it speak.
   - "I am here because you rejected me. I am here because you were ashamed. I am here because you would not love me."
3. **Love the Beast** – Do not try to transform the Beast. Love it **as Beast**.
   - "I see you. I accept you. You are not monstrous—you are mine."
4. **The transformation** – When the Beast is truly loved, it transforms. Not because you forced it, but because **acceptance is the alchemy**.
5. **Marry the Prince** – Integrate the transformed Shadow. The Beast becomes the Prince—the instinctual power now aligned with conscious purpose.

---

## The Gift of the Broken Spell

When the curse is consciously engaged and the spell is broken, the following gifts emerge:

1. **Reclaimed Vitality** – The frozen parts thaw; feeling, desire, and aliveness return. The Dead Zone blooms.
2. **Authentic Voice** – The stolen voice is reclaimed. You can speak your truth, sing your song, express your soul without fear.
3. **Embodied Power** – The Beast is integrated. Instinct, sexuality, anger, and drive are no longer exiled but aligned with conscious purpose.
4. **Freedom from Fate** – The "just-so story" dissolves. You are no longer cursed, fated, or waiting for rescue. You are **awake, autonomous, alive**.
5. **The Awakened Self** – Sleeping Beauty becomes queen, the Beast becomes prince, the swan-maiden reclaims her skin. The curse's breaking is not return to the old self but **birth of the new Self**—the integrated, individuated, fully awake.

---

**Final Reflection:**

*The curse is the soul's way of saying: "Not yet. You are not ready. I will freeze time, lock you in sleep, transform you into beast or stone until the inner work completes." The curse is both prison and chrysalis. To break it, you must name it, engage it, and love what it protects. The spell is broken not by force but by recognition: "I am not cursed—I am becoming."*

*"The sleeping beauty does not wake because the prince arrives. She wakes because she is ready, and the prince is the sign that readiness has arrived."*

— Alchemical Wisdom
