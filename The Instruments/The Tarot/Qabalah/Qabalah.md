# Qabalah
*The Received Tradition — Architecture of Divine Emanation*

---

## Overview

**Qabalah** (Hebrew: קבלה, *qabbalah* — "that which is received") is the Jewish mystical tradition describing the structure of creation, the nature of divinity, and the relationship between the Infinite and the finite. Within [[The Tarot]] pillar, Qabalah provides the **architectural framework** — the scaffolding upon which the 78 cards are arranged, the map that transforms a deck of images into a coherent system of spiritual navigation.

The Qabalah did not originate as a Tarot system. Its roots reach into Talmudic speculation on the *Ma'aseh Merkavah* (Work of the Chariot) and *Ma'aseh Bereshit* (Work of Creation), codified in the *Sefer Yetzirah* (3rd-6th century CE) [^1] and flowering in the *Zohar* (13th century, attributed to Shimon bar Yochai) [^2]. The systematic mapping of Tarot onto the Qabalistic Tree came through the Western esoteric tradition — principally Eliphas Levi (1856), the [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] (1888), and their successors [^3].

Three spellings reflect three distinct streams:
- **Kabbalah** — The Jewish religious mystical tradition (Scholem, Idel)
- **Cabala** — The Christian esoteric interpretation (Pico della Mirandola, Reuchlin)
- **Qabalah** — The Hermetic/magical tradition used within the Golden Dawn and Western esotericism [^4] (Wang 1983, Fortune 1935)

This library uses **Qabalah** to denote the Hermetic synthesis as it functions within the Tarot pillar — while honoring its Jewish origins and acknowledging that the esoteric tradition operates at a considerable distance from its rabbinical source.

## Core Architecture

### The Tree of Life

The [[The Tree of Life]] is the central glyph of Qabalah — a diagram of ten [[Sephiroth]] (emanations) connected by twenty-two Paths, depicting the process by which the Infinite unfolds into manifest creation and the route by which consciousness may return to its source.

| Component | Count | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| [[Sephiroth]] | 10 | Stations of divine emanation — states of being |
| Paths | 22 | Connections between Sephiroth — processes of becoming |
| [[Daath]] | 1 | The non-Sephirah — Knowledge, the Abyss crossing |
| [[Four Worlds]] | 4 | Levels of reality from archetype to matter |
| Three Pillars | 3 | [[Pillar of Mercy]], [[Pillar of Severity]], [[Middle Pillar]] |

### The Ten Sephiroth

| # | Sephirah | Translation | Planet | Pillar |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | [[Kether]] | Crown | Primum Mobile | Middle |
| 2 | [[Chokmah]] | Wisdom | Stars/Zodiac | Mercy |
| 3 | [[Binah]] | Understanding | [[Saturn ♄]] | Severity |
| 4 | [[Chesed]] | Mercy | [[Jupiter ♃]] | Mercy |
| 5 | [[Geburah]] | Strength | [[Mars ♂]] | Severity |
| 6 | [[Tiphareth]] | Beauty | [[Sun ☉]] | Middle |
| 7 | [[Netzach]] | Victory | [[Venus ♀]] | Mercy |
| 8 | [[Hod]] | Splendor | Mercury ☿ | Severity |
| 9 | [[Yesod]] | Foundation | [[Moon ☽]] | Middle |
| 10 | [[Malkuth]] | Kingdom | Earth | Middle |

### The Twenty-Two Paths and the Tarot

Each of the 22 Paths corresponds to a Major Arcanum, a Hebrew letter, and an astrological attribution. The Paths are the **processes** connecting the Sephiroth — where the Sephiroth are nouns (states of being), the Paths are verbs (modes of transition). See [[The Tarot]] for the complete Path-to-card mapping.

### The Four Worlds

The Tree exists simultaneously at four levels of reality:

| World | Hebrew | Translation | Level | Tarot Suit |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Atziluth | אצילות | Emanation | Archetypal | Wands (Fire) |
| Briah | בריאה | Creation | Creative | Cups (Water) |
| Yetzirah | יצירה | Formation | Formative | Swords (Air) |
| Assiah | עשיה | Action | Material | Pentacles (Earth) |

See [[Four Worlds]] for comprehensive treatment.

## The Qabalah in the Tarot Pillar

Within this library, the Qabalah subsystem provides:

- **The Sephiroth** — Ten emanations as the structural skeleton of the Tree. Each Sephirah corresponds to a numbered card in the Minor Arcana (Aces = Kether, Twos = Chokmah, etc.).
- **The Paths** — Twenty-two connections as the Major Arcana. Each path carries a Hebrew letter, an astrological force, and a transformative process.
- **The Pillars and Structures** — The three pillars (Mercy, Severity, Middle), the [[Supernal Triangle]], [[The Abyss]], and [[Daath]] as organizational principles.
- **The Divine Names** — The names of God associated with each Sephirah, functioning as vibratory keys in meditation and ritual. See [[Divine Names]].
- **The Shadow System** — The [[Qlippoth]] (husks/shells) as the reverse or unbalanced expression of each Sephirah.
- **Specialized Concepts** — [[Ain Soph Aur]], [[Merkabah Mysticism]], and [[Shekinah]] as foundational theological concepts.

---

## Qabalah and the Other Pillars

The Qabalah is formally housed within the Tarot pillar because the two systems are **structurally inseparable** — the Tree provides the architecture that organizes the 78 cards. But its correspondences reach across all seven pillars:

- **[[Angelology]]** — Each Sephirah has a governing Archangel and Angelic Order
- **[[Astrology]]** — Planetary attributions to Sephiroth; zodiacal attributions to Paths
- **[[Personal Mythos]]** — The Individuation Process as ascent on the Tree; [[The Shadow]] as Qlippothic encounter
- **[[Human Design]]** — The 64 Gates mapped through the I-Ching share the same 64-fold architecture underlying the Tree's numerical emanation
- **[[The Magdalene Path]]** — The vertical ascent through the [[Middle Pillar]] as contemplative prayer practice
- **[[The Astrolabe]]** — The Codex's eight trigram families as another expression of emanation from unity to multiplicity
