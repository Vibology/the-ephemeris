# Left Angle Cross of Wishes (2)

## Gates: 50/3/31/41 | Quarter of Duality

### Ra's Keynote
> "People with a utopian orientation that transcends traditional values, who challenge both cultural and religious standards by projecting what the system might be."[^1]

## The Four Gates

### Personality Sun: Gate 50 - The Cauldron (Values)
**Center:** Spleen | **Circuitry:** Tribal Ego (Defense)

Gate 50 is the **instinctual awareness of tribal values and laws**—the custodianship that preserves collective well-being. As the Personality Sun, this defines the conscious purpose: to hold and potentially transform the values that govern society.

### Personality Earth: Gate 3 - Difficulty at the Beginning (Ordering)
**Center:** Sacral | **Circuitry:** Individual Knowing

Gate 3 grounds the values awareness with **the power to bring new order from chaos**. This provides the mutative life force needed to sustain innovation when traditional values are being challenged and reformed.

### Design Sun: Gate 31 - Influence (Leading)
**Center:** Throat | **Circuitry:** Collective Logic

Gate 31 operates unconsciously as **the voice of democratic leadership**—the capacity to articulate direction that others choose to follow. This fuels the cross with influential speech that can challenge and redirect collective understanding.

### Design Earth: Gate 41 - Decrease (Contraction)
**Center:** Root | **Circuitry:** Collective Abstract

Gate 41 grounds the leadership voice with **the pressure to imagine new experiences**. The fantasy of what the system might become provides the fuel for the utopian projection.

## Cross Theme

The **LAX of Wishes (2)** in the Quarter of Duality carries the archetype of the **trans-personal values transformer**—one whose karmic purpose involves challenging and transcending traditional cultural and religious standards.

As a **Left Angle Cross**, this is a trans-personal destiny. The individual does not live primarily for themselves but carries a karmic contract to project utopian possibilities that challenge existing value systems. Their relationships are vehicles for this provocative vision.

This cross bridges four circuits:
- **Tribal Ego/Defense** (50): Values and custodianship
- **Individual Knowing** (3): Mutation and innovation
- **Collective Logic** (31): Democratic leadership
- **Collective Abstract** (41): Fantasy and experiential pressure

In the Quarter of Duality (Bonding), this Wishes fulfills its purpose through **relationships and partnerships**. The custodianship of values (Gate 50) combined with leadership voice (Gate 31) creates individuals who enter bonds specifically to challenge and transform traditional standards.

The trans-personal nature means these utopian visions are not personal fantasies alone—they are meant to influence how others understand what society might become.

## Quarter Context

**Quarter of Duality | Realm of Jupiter | Purpose through Bonding**

In this quarter, the Left Angle Cross of Wishes fulfills its karmic purpose through **partnerships that challenge tradition**. The awareness of tribal values (Gate 50) combined with the leadership voice (Gate 31) creates individuals who bond with others specifically to transform cultural and religious standards.

The 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, and 6/3 profiles associated with Left Angle Crosses bring their own dynamics:
- **5/1 and 5/2**: The heretic/savior projected upon to know what values should be, often called in when traditional systems are failing
- **6/2 and 6/3**: The role model who demonstrates through lived example how to transcend outdated standards, becoming the elder reformer

---

## Shadow Expression

- **Destructive iconoclasm:** Challenging traditional values without offering viable alternatives
- **Utopian disconnection:** Projecting impossible ideals that create despair rather than inspiration
- **Values manipulation:** Using custodianship to impose personal preferences as universal standards
- **Revolutionary chaos:** Bringing new order that does not actually serve collective well-being
- **Influential but groundless:** Articulating visions that cannot be sustained through their difficult beginnings

---

## Highest Expression

- **Values evolution:** Understanding which traditional standards genuinely need transformation and which preserve essential wisdom
- **Grounded utopianism:** Projecting what the system might be in ways that are achievable, not merely ideal
- **Influential reform:** Using democratic leadership voice to guide collective values transformation
- **Karmic partnership:** Fulfilling the trans-personal destiny by bonding with those who need this challenge to tradition
- **Sustainable innovation:** Having the life force (Gate 3) to sustain values reformation through its difficult beginnings
